I have scoured the message boards and found a few people suffering from the same, but without answers.
PLEASE OFFER INSIGHT! I will be so grateful
look up something called derealization. it seems scary but common
TAYLOR my man, listen to me. I know what you have. You have MOLD somewhere in your house.youve been breathing it for antime and your immune system just let go. Look up aspergiliosis mold. Those are the exact symptomes. I cant beleive everybody is telling you that you are depressed.
Do you live in a humid or water dammaged home ?
You have to do a keto diet. Send me an email if you want. Sunshinefrost at msn
Mold really affects the brain, you lose interest in everything and your working memory shuts down
With persistance symptoms of congnitive difficulties like poor memory and poor concentration, onset of severe and cronic psychological conditions like anxiety and depression, cronic sleeping problems, cronic daytime fatigue, body aches like fibromialgia, and other unexplained cronic health conditions - all starting with a period of flu like symptoms - then it is most likely some variation of lyme or simular tick(vector) born bacterial infection. It's hard to diagnose lyme in stage two and stage three (cronic lyme) because traditional lab tests and diagnostic protocols do not work effectively after the initial period of flu like symptoms.
Hi david did your condition get better after treating with antibiotics for lyme ?? Please let us know . Thank yoy
Did the iv help?? How are you feeling ?
what youre suffering is depersonalization. It is imperative you try meds with the right help from a professional. The problem is chemical. theres hope and sometimes talking to someone isnt enough sometimes we have to do what feels foreign to see results. Cant hurt to try as long as there is supervision
All of you are deficient in iodine. Google it.
Yes, you are correct.
This is such a irresponsible blanket statement. While this might be true for some people there a certainly others that don`t have an iodine deficiency. And for what it`s worth, over supplementing with iodine can do more harm then good, especially if taken for too long at a higher dose.
how are u guys all doing with your brain fog?
Try Kelp supplement which is rich in iodine. Should do the trick.
Did improved any specific symptoms or overall? Im going to need a second chance with meds.
when im relaxed it improves a little
Well that part of my problem. Very dificult to relax when not remembering. I try it all the time, but the idea of not remembering makes me feel unconfortable.
My guess would be that the Zoloft might help but it will not help with your main symptoms.
Some people in here might suffer from the same, it often takes a long time to be diagnosed because there are no headaches, so most doctors and even neurologists overlook the possibility.
aww i hope u feel better
Brainfog, waking up groggy, not being able to concentrate/think properly, fatigue, tingling limbs, nausea, twitching muscles, head pressure, dizziness, hypersensitivity to light/noise, blurred vision etc. Kind of vague complaints, I imagine there are a lot of people misdiagnosed with anxiety, since these complaints can make one feel quite anxious eventually.
I think it's slowly happening less and less but the worry of it is always there. What does your dr say ? How long u had it?
I`m kind of wondering, none of you has have thought that this could be something more serious. Like an early onset dementia or MS?
Hi Rockers I thought about this and just the thought sends shivers up my spine.
Tyler did the meds help ?
Just saw that your post is over a year old so I hope you got some help!
I'll keep you updated and hope you do the same
Hi rex how are you doing these days ? Pls let us know
What is it that you have
Have you recovered from this ?
How are things for you now?
Please tell me you have found the answers!
Depression is a nasty thing/idea. To think of depression people who have never undergone any stage of it are just responding, ""you can make it better"" ""its all in your head"". But the truth is its not just a figment of your imagination, its your life. If you believe in Karma you can be caught under the Karma of others. Some people are more likely to tap into that Karma and it can destroy them. People who are more in tuned with the world, with life, find themselves bogged down by it. The over active mind can't run for decades on that kind of stress/adrenaline as seen with my own mother.
Now I know I've gotten a bit off topic, but I'm just speaking from personal experiences.
And I'd have to say, no to the drugs, no to the doctors who want to put you on more.
Find yourself, get balanced and get grounded. Practice different meditation's, and that's not just sitting in the lotus position and humming,"" Ohm"".
It can be as simple as reading a book, going for a walk or a hike in the woods or mountains(if you live near any). Reducing how much others rely on you, you need time for you. Do research into the chakras, karma(and that doesn't just mean you did something to deserve anything) past life regressions even. Most importantly be open to anything that could help you.
If your a savant(learned person) of any kind, you need time to relax and recharge.
Hoping you find some peace of mind,
Sounds a bit like depersonalization
Hey Taylor, I have read your note on your problems and it has been a year, has there been any change since? Have you gotten better, and if so.. Could you share?
How are things for you??
I've learned some interesting charactoristics about the fog too:
#1 Smoking weed can take it from bad to unfathomably bad.
From doing lot's of reading on Brain fog and this seemingly can be from a bunch of factors, make sure these things are checked
If anybody needs help or has any questions please feel free to message me.
Taylor, I'd be curious to find out if you have found any solutions to your condition.
I have followed some of the stories about towns being evacuated from contamination in the water at their homes. Now follow me for a second, because although it might start sounding overly dramatic, there are many symptoms that people don't realize come from a very basic source of life, water. But, not because it's natural water, but because the water served to our homes is filled with chemicals and in certain cases, have been contaminated with leaks of gases and other dangerous chemicals to our system. These people being evacuated have suffered from major illnesses, so the contamination has been very high.
But, in most cities, water is ""filtered and decontaminated"" with 2 of the chemicals we deem as safe, because we see it in toothpaste and swimming pools, which are fluoride and chlorine. These are the known symptoms correlated to these chemicals: Depression, low energy, fatigue, low concentration, poor memory, foginess reduced sex drive, headaches, tendencies towards excessive weight.
In short, I just want to propose, since most have you seem to have tried everything, continue to work hard on an organic, clean diet, and excercise, but also take into serious consideration your water source and any products that contain fluoride and chlorine. I have a strong feeling that will make a big difference. If you can, find water from a natural spring, and use it for every need including showers, because the skin absorbs a lot of what goes on it. Don't use skin products, our body produces everything we need, and if you have to, find natural ones.
Also, if you can't find a natural spring, get a serious water filter for your entire home. I would really like to hear if you find this helps, although it might take some time.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Deficiency in B12 causes all of these symptoms, and it can take years before it will show up in a blood test.
Neurologists generally suggest taking B12 supplements for a few weeks to see if they help.
