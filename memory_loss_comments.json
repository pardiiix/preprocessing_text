   "comments": "I'm 25 years old and After a night of drinking, I feel funny to this day. The alcohol affected me by making me believe I'm in a dream and I'm not myself. My vision is weird it's like I capture moments of what I see and when I speak, it's like im not speaking or somewhat like that. I feel all round funny, I look at my own body sometimes and think is this really me? It seems that during the day when the sun is out is when I'm at my worst but when it gets dark and almost bed time, I feel better. It's weird living like this, it's hard for me to process things. It's hard for me to put sentences together and hard to remember things I did throughout the day. I'm also forgetful. My eyes are sensitive to sunlight also. It's like I'm half awake and half asleep. I'm also going through a breakup with a girl whom I have a kid with and she's with someone else now but I don't really care now about who she's with. I'm more worried about myself. It's hard waking up every morning and feeling like this throughout the day, I just want to be normal.\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "I've read your symptoms and situation, and it seems very simular to my own experience during stage two lyme desease. I can't say that you have lyme but based on the sudden onset, the symptoms, the persistance of those symptoms and the fact that you have ruled out so many other possible causes I would say it is likely that you have some sort of brain/neurological infection.\nWith persistance symptoms of congnitive difficulties like poor memory and poor concentration, onset of severe and cronic psychological conditions like anxiety and depression, cronic sleeping problems, cronic daytime fatigue, body aches like fibromialgia, and other unexplained cronic health conditions - all starting with a period of flu like symptoms - then it is most likely some variation of lyme or simular tick(vector) born bacterial infection. It's hard to diagnose lyme in stage two and stage three (cronic lyme) because traditional lab tests and diagnostic protocols do not work effectively after the initial period of flu like symptoms.\nMost lyme illiterate doctors will give up on finding the source of the problem and try treating symptoms with medications for sleep, anxiety, and depression. Unfortunatly, all anti-depression meds acutally make the condition worse. The only medication I found to provide short term releif was high strenth amphetamines, perscribed for fatigue symptoms, that supprisingly resolved many of the other symptoms temporarilly. I had to go through 6 months of IV antibiotic infussions to effectivly treat the condition.\nReport\nReply"

I have had similar symptoms myself for the past 7 years( i am 26 now) and still cant make heads or tails of them. I feel like I have seen every specialist known to man and now Im at the place of thinking this may be depression. However, taking medication seems daunting because from what Ive heard and read on these posts, it seems like meds do not really cure people completely. I may be making a false generalization, so if someone can say otherwise that would be great. When dealing with obscure health ailments such as chronic fatigue/brain fog that many people do not even believe are real it is important to support one another and give testimony when healing takes place. It will give hope to the rest of us.\nReport\n1\nReply"

Then I noticed one day while at work that I had vision problems on the right eye. Somehow there was a white spot in my field of vision. This got worse as I was on my way home riding my bike. That spot really disturbed my vision on my right side badly. Well of course this all cleare up fairly quickly, no one thought of it as anything important. And from thenb on I regulalry got wired stuff poping up. Now I get mainly on my right side of the body joint aches.

Even when I went to my doctor to explain what was going on with me it felt like when she told me depression that it couldn't be depression I'm not sad I'm going crazy in my brain my memory's out of whack\n, my body feels different, I'm starting to forget who I am, I was unstable, and out of control, and I don't socialize like I used to I could talk and talk all day and make people laugh and now its just like I'm quiet and can't think at all like you said just going through the motions suffering that's how it feels. But you know what the doctor was right with the diagnosis, I still wonder if it could be something else but I took antidepressants and it actually gave me the biggest boost I felt so damn good for like a year and a bit now I feel like I need anti depressants again like my brain just needs that extra boost again to get rid of the fog and give me my energy and happiness back. What's weird is I used to have ADHD and now its more like ADD and I have dementia, people tell me all the time things that we've done together in the past and anything well most things I've done since I've had this going on feels like a dream if I try to remember or I just can't remember its just all a blur. But if anyone has figured out the memory part of this bull can someone please msg asap because I'd really like to get this done with in my life its basically the only thing that bugs me I feel like if I could remember how I used to I would be so happy!

Everything went downhill from there, I lost any want to do more then just work and be left alone. It had gotten worse for a while, the job I loved, i lost(because of the ex) and that depressed me more.\nDepression is a nasty thing/idea. To think of depression people who have never undergone any stage of it are just responding, \"you can make it better\" \"its all in your head\". But the truth is its not just a figment of your imagination, its your life. If you believe in Karma you can be caught under the Karma of others. Some people are more likely to tap into that Karma and it can destroy them. People who are more in tuned with the world, with life, find themselves bogged down by it. The over active mind can't run for decades on that kind of stress/adrenaline as seen with my own mother.\nNow I know I've gotten a bit off topic, but I'm just speaking from personal experiences.\nAnd I'd have to say, no to the drugs, no to the doctors who want to put you on more.\nFind yourself, get balanced and get grounded. Practice different meditation's, and that's not just sitting in the lotus position and humming,\" Ohm\".\nIt can be as simple as reading a book, going for a walk or a hike in the woods or mountains(if you live near any). Reducing how much others rely on you, you need time for you. Do research into the chakras, karma(and that doesn't just mean you did something to deserve anything) past life regressions even. Most importantly be open to anything that could help you.\nIf your a savant(learned person) of any kind, you need time to relax and recharge.\nHoping you find some peace of mind,\nAutumn\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "Hey Taylor,\nOur stories are scary simular. Just wanted to say first off, hang in there....this goes for everybody!. If a couple good friends/family memebers don't know about your issue(fog) make sure you change that fast, you need the support and if you have a starnge feeling of guilt...get rid of it.\nI'm currently 36 but back in college when I was 21, I woke up one day with this fog. Almost feels like a pressure or like somebody put a vaccum against your ear and sucked some air out and then sealed it quickly.\nWhat is does:\nGeneral feeling of uncomfotableness in my head\nBrutal Memory..just brutal\nInability to concentrate\nProcessing speed of information reduced\nAs a side product from clearly not being myself and being scared and stressed about the future, I also became depressed but I feel it's a product of circumstance.\nAfter visiting neoroigists, eye doctors, gereral practicians, MRI blood tests and coming up with nothing....eventually...somehow it went away...at least briefly.\nMy Doctor had me on Paxil as a \" well, why not..nothing else is working kind of thing\". So i originally attributed it going away maybe because of it but after years of trial and error, the Paxil just triples the memory nukage and while it it I can still get the fog.\nI've learned some interesting charactoristics about the fog too:\n#1 Smoking weed can take it from bad to unfathomably bad.\n#2 For some reason, it seems like I have a light tremor in my teeth...ever so slight when I put them together I can feel it\nFrom doing lot's of reading on Brain fog and this seemingly can be from a bunch of factors, make sure these things are checked:\nLyme disease\nThyroid\nB- Vitamins\nGluten sensitivity\nI've mainly been grinding for 15 years. I worry about losing my wife/job all the way to being on the streets because of this terrible condition that kno body seems to have any clue about.\nFor me at least I seemingly get breaks from it which is a lot more then some people reading these forums.\nEverybody please continue to share any or all new information so we can help each other.\nIf anybody needs help or has any questions please feel free to message me.\nPaj\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "Taylor, I'd be curious to find out if you have found any solutions to your condition.\nI have followed some of the stories about towns being evacuated from contamination in the water at their homes. Now follow me for a second, because although it might start sounding overly dramatic, there are many symptoms that people don't realize come from a very basic source of life, water. But, not because it's natural water, but because the water served to our homes is filled with chemicals and in certain cases, have been contaminated with leaks of gases and other dangerous chemicals to our system. These people being evacuated have suffered from major illnesses, so the contamination has been very high.\nBut, in most cities, water is \"filtered and decontaminated\" with 2 of the chemicals we deem as safe, because we see it in toothpaste and swimming pools, which are fluoride and chlorine. These are the known symptoms correlated to these chemicals: Depression, low energy, fatigue, low concentration, poor memory, foginess reduced sex drive, headaches, tendencies towards excessive weight.\nIn short, I just want to propose, since most have you seem to have tried everything, continue to work hard on an organic, clean diet, and excercise, but also take into serious consideration your water source and any products that contain fluoride and chlorine. I have a strong feeling that will make a big difference. If you can, find water from a natural spring, and use it for every need including showers, because the skin absorbs a lot of what goes on it. Don't use skin products, our body produces everything we need, and if you have to, find natural ones.\nAlso, if you can't find a natural spring, get a serious water filter for your entire home. I would really like to hear if you find this helps, although it might take some time.\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\nReport\nReply"

My symptoms--brain fog, extreme fatigue, memory struggles, and the ever-present zombie-bubble-head sensation--are my reality three or more days a week. It seems to be getting worse. I also experience mouth (tongue and lip) tingling, low grade fevers during sleep, and occasional but persistent edema. (I've been taking hydrochlorothiazide for the edema for years, but now its not working as well...)\nAnother clue, in case anyone finds similarities...I relocated to the Chicago suburbs from the Southeastern US approximately one and a half years ago. (July 2014) After my first full night in the area--eating the food, drinking the water--I woke the next morning with a debilitating fatigue and a physiological-level depression that kept me in the hotel bed the entire next day. I was barely able to leave the room. The next day, I was exhausted but able to get up and out. I didn't connect it to my relocation until a year later when I noticed my symptoms were graduatlly worse over the next year.\nNow, my brain fog / fatigue symptoms are worse and more \"regular\" every other day and for days at a time.\nIs this the my new reality?\nThank you so very much for posting this Taylor. You've helped me more than you can know. It helps me just knowing I'm not the only one this is / has happened to. I have an appointment tomorrow to discuss testing.

   "comments": "Hi everyone. Taylor, I first would like to thank you for creating this thread. It seems like a lot of people can relate to your situation; myself included. I am deeply sorry that you are expericing these feelings, and hope that as a year has passed, you have found some relief with your symptoms.\nThat being said, I can understand how you feel. I am currently 22, male, and have extreme brain fog... My mental sharpness and clarity has not been the same for a few months now. I've been so spacey, tired, headaches/migraines. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at age 11, and it has been with me since, although at that age I struggled more with suicidal thoughts than your typical brain fog symptoms like we are expericing now.\nI'll give a more comprehensive list of my symptoms:\n- Scatter brained.\n- Loss of concentration.\n- Horrible memory. Forgetting names, requests, etc, easily.\n- Headaches, migraines.\n- Anxiety, rapid heart rate.\n- Racing thoughts, jumbled thoughts, and random repetitive thoughts.\n- Major highs and lows (could possibly be bipolar... I am in the process of getting reevaluted by a psychiatrist)\n- Crying spells and suicidal thoughts on my worst days.\nMy cause of this is most likely depression. I've been through a lot in the past year alone (two major family deaths, a messy break up from a 2 y/o relationship) ... It has been such a difficult time.\nI used to be so independent and so driven to do anything I set my mind to. My mind is so weak now, that I can only do my basic necessities throughout the day and then some. I find it harder and harder to do anything else. I work as a freelance artist for a living so my livelihood solely depends on my drive and what I can manage to do.\nI have the motivation to do what I'd like - but I just can't. I have so many dreams and aspirations... It's so frustrating to be held back by this chemical imbalance. I know I shouldn't let it hold me back, but it's gotten so bad that it cannot be helped. I'm hoping that therapy and perhaps some new medication will help me. I'm currently on Topamax, Effexor, and Remeron. I've heard some nasty things about Effexor affecting your memory - so that very well may be one of the components to why I have such bad memory.\nAnyway, sorry for the long message. I doubt it will be thoroughly read, but I figured I'd share my experience somewhere. This seemed like a nice place to do so.\nBe well everyone. I wish you all the very best.\nReport\nReply"

Ive pretty much had every symptom listed including hairloss, chronic fatigue, and deep muscle constriction/tension. Its probably the worst thing in the world, feeling trapped in your own mind/body. My symptoms, horrid symptoms, appeared three days after a simple surgical procedure under anesthesia.\nMy question to everyone would be do you think there is a trauma in your life that triggered this? keep in mind trauma can be something supressed from your conscious for years. Medication related? Or did this appear one day out or the blue?\nDoes anyone notice significant hair loss with this and did it ever grow back?\nYou can PM me if you want. Id like to do some kind of qualitative study on this based on what possibly caused this. I know many fingers point simply to an anxiety disorder and high stress, which I do not doubt either.

I could easily put my car in park at a red light and tell my kids to wake me when it turns red- and yess I can fall asleep. I have had one neurologist send me to another . I have seen endocrinologist. I have been on anti depressants. The month have March has by far been debilitating. I live in a fog! I can barely get one foot in front of another. The MD's only want to give me meds but no one can tell me whats going on with me. Last the neurologist wanted to put me on Methadone to help me sleep at night. I was like are you joking! I said put it in my chart right now - that is not an option!! I have 3 kids and I am so so exhausted!

Good to read though you don't accept just meds, but would like to know the cause.\nJust to check: were your vit.B12 (should be =/>350) and D (should be =/>75)checked? Was sleep apnea ruled out?

   "comments": "Firstly; you are not insane and you have got real and serious health problems, like many of us. Since you work in the medical profession you probably know that doctors don't like 'vague', diffuse and systemic complaints. Also they draw strict lines when it comes to blood values.\nIf your cortisol is raised there is definitely something not right. There is quite a big range between normal cortisol and Cushings, and you can feel pretty miserable in between. I'm a health professional myself and am specialized in treating people with burnout (and sleep problems) so am well aware of problems which could arise from chronic elevated cortisol levels. The symptoms you describe match with it: the inability to get deep sleep at night, nausea and vertigo, the extreme fatigue during day time. The root cause could be restless legs syndrome (sleep deprivation causes elevated cortisol levels), it's a bit of a chicken or egg question. If I may ask: which advise did you get on the RLS?\nThough I am not an MD I would like to recommend to you to quit the stimulants; it is just symptom management, and if your adrenals are already overactive it can cause adrenal exhaustion in the end, which is a place you definitely don't want to go.\nAgain, I realy recommend to have a look at your vitamine B12 and D results; the ranges are set way to low. B12 should really be 350 or above to feel well. Often the bottom limit is set to 150 and you get the message everything is fine when it actually isn't. Same goes for vit. D (with 75 as bottom value).\nFor some reason deficiencies in these often go hand in hand with elevated cortisol.\nI hope your new doctor takes the effort to really get to the bottom of your complaints, and he is able to see the bigger picture. At least you don't seem the person to give up on this, hang on in there.\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "I was having the same exact feelings, episodes, heavy feeling in my head, my brain covered in a fog, can not get motivated, can not set daily plans, anxiety when I would have to talk to anyone outside of my family and finally I took a stand to get help from my doctor.\nThe week before going to a doctor I couldn't even talk to my kids as I was in a complete no zone of any thoughts. I would do my daily routines of taking dad to VA and kids to school, then come home,and literally pass out as if I haven't slept in days. I knew it was depression, yet I wasn't angry or upset. I was a bit sad and very lethargic.\nI would sleep all night and much of the day, yet I felt like I was still tired. It was all\nanxiety/depression caused by lack of Serotonin in the brain. The more you get depressed, anxiety or stressed, serotonin decreses in the brain. Then at times your brain will use the serotonin it has and it's a quick boost, but not enough to keep functioning as normal. Sorta like a Diabetic how your blood sugar raises at a spike and you have to take meds to bring it back down and elevate it. In this case though we need an anti-depressant to bring back out serotonin and elevate the brain imbalance.\nI was once a CNA and Phlebotomist. I was the kind hearted woman to help those in need of care, love and compassion. I was at the bedside of many who where in a hospice stage until they passed. I was the one to hold a family together during the loss of their family member offering support, love and compassion walking them through this stage. So, I have seen depression among many and That is how I finally realized I needed help myself. I am an Empath who wears my heart on my sleeve. So, I feel everything with my heart before it reaches my brain.\nI was given buPROPion HCL XL 150MG. This is for major depression and seasonal depression. It helps restore the brain. Very few side effects unlike other meds.\nI wish you all the best of health and life and hope you all find help and get better and back to yourself.\nGod Bless\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "Hi Taylor,\nI want to offer you a somewhat different insight as to your brain fog and various other issues because I had a very similar episode that went unchecked for several years. One day I bumped into a friend I hadn't seen for a long time and he asked how I was feeling (he happened to be a clinical phycologist and the world's number one specialist in biofeedback and neural feedback) so I told him I felt spaced out, foggy, tired and unable to concentrate.\nThat got me a visit to his office in Calgary (Canada) where he explained how the brain works in regard to its various brain wave patterns.\nBare with me as I need to digress. Everything in the Universe vibrates, especially the human brain. We have five basic levels of brain vibration or brain waves. The lowest are called Delta and are present when we are in a very deep sleep. Up one we find Theta which represents a light sleep. In the middle we have Alpha which is a daydream state. Then Beta which is our normal waking state and at the top is Gamma which is when we are very alert and also very anxious.\nHe likened these states to a five-speed gearbox in a car. In a normal brain, all five, lubricated, gears are well used. However, sometimes, maybe due to stress, the car gets stuck in one of those five gears. With hyper-active people, (ADHD) it gets stuck in Gamma but when it gets stuck in Alpha, you experience pretty much the symptoms you described.\nHe ran a bunch of tests and determined I was stuck in Alpha. How did he figure that out? Briefly, he attached electrodes to various parts on my scalp (totally painless) that were hooked to a computer. Then I wore goggles that had tiny lights embedded in them (they were designed so I couldn't see thru them). We know that our brains are affecting by many things, including flashing lights. So the computer measured my brain waves (Alpha) then programmed the mini-lights in the goggles to flash at a sequence that would attact my brain to reach Beta.\nWhat?\nThe best way I can describe it is for you to hold both hands in front of you and make like they are duck beaks. Now slowly open and close your left hand so your thumb and first finger touch every second or so. Now do the same with your right hand but speed it up so your finger and thumb touch twice a second. Now, your slower left hand 'senses' the faster right hand and begins to search for it. When it comes into contact, it begins to mimic the speed of the right hand. So your left hand represents your Alpha brain wave state and your right hand represents the Beta state as programmed by the computer. So the exercise serves to pour a little oil in the old gear box. The process is called ENTRAINMENT and after just two 20 minute sessions, I felt something very strange happen, like I'd been in a dark world when someone turned on the light. There is a definite science behind Entrainment and you might want to check around (look for a phycologist in your area who offers it).\nSorry this was soooo long but hopefully it helps, Taylor and do keep in touch, there are a lot of people besides me rooting for you on this site.\nbest always,\nmyc\nEmis Moderator comment: I have removed product/company names as we do not allow repeated posting of these in the forums.

I used to suffer with depression and anxiety much more in the past so I know the brain fog from depression and this is slightly different because I'm currently not feeling depressed. A few weeks ago I stopped eating gluten and I actually felt much better, and told myself to not eat it anymore but then I did anyways and the brain fog started to creep back and the memory loss and just feeling like i wasn'the all there, it actually wasn't that bad until today I had a piece of a baguette and I felt HORRIBLE afterwards, I pretty much passed out because I was so tired. Like others have said I exercise and eat relatively healthy and even do yoga everyday which is why I know the brain fog is not due to depression or anxiety or stress anymore. I'm going gluten free for good now because I hate feeling this way. I'm also very intelligent and used to have the best memory and be able to multitask and focus and concentrate and I want that all back, so we shall see.

When I first got depression at the age 17, it took me nearly 6 months to stop being suicidal. It took me more than a year to accept that I had an illness. Not to discourage you, but it took nearly two years to learn to live with it. Thinking back to it now, I should've sought help sooner. You can really curb the effects depression has on you. Seek help as soon as possible. I let mine fester for 7 years until I developed terrible anxiety. The more you let depression take it's course, the harder it will be to undo habits. All my best wishes to you! Things do get easier. If there's anything depression teaches you, it's PATIENCE.\nReport\nReply"

After 8 years I was finally diagnosed with Celiac Disease. Additionally, my vitamin D levels were extremely low (8ng/ml). I had doctors wanting to diagnosed me with depression mainly due to the fatigue), but they were overlooking the most important criteria, a depressed mood. I did start having panic attacks many years after living with brain fog, memory loss, fatigue, but it was mainly due to my brain fog. It was hard to interact with others. On really bad days i could barely comprehend what people were talking about.

On Wednesday 25th May, I returned home early from work having been unwell for the previous three weeks with what was initially diagnosed as a Quinsy abscess/severe Tonsillitis, During this time I was extremely unwell and prescribed three different types of Antibiotics, I'm not sure if this initial illness is in some way linked to what I'm going to share, But it gives a full picture of what's been happening. During this period of time, alongside being extremely physically unwell, I was experiencing overwhelming feelings of stress, anxiety and worry having recently started a new job and being in my probationary period, having to take time off sick which was unpaid and worrying about a number of financial implications and a few on going personal issues.\nI returned home on Wednesday 25th May and at this point in time my cognitive functioning and thought process was clear. I felt physically exhausted and decided to have a nap at around 6pm, I woke up around 8pm with a very faint pain in my head, and feeling in what I can only describe as a state of shock about my current situation of being unwell, worried about my new job, money, being able to pay the rent if I didn't pass my probation due to sickness etc. I felt in a state of shock, and suddenly I was unable to think, unable to process thoughts, I closed my eyes to try and get to sleep and suddenly there was nothing? I've always had a very sharp mind, clear loud thoughts and a photographic memory but suddenly there was nothing? I immediately panicked and contacted my mother to try and explain what was happening, I suddenly had a blank mind. Like someone had turned the switch to off? I couldn't visualise anything, couldn't process thoughts, It's like I closed my eyes and there was nothing there - If you asked me to imagine a tropical island or an animal I couldn't. My vision was blurred, I felt spaced out, anything that happened I suddenly couldn't remember, or something that happened five minutes ago felt/feels like it was months ago, I can't remember anything visually since this happened. I can remember things factually (Who I am, where I live etc but that's it), I immediately went to my GP to explain what had happened and the fact I suddenly was unable to sleep, was experiencing memory loss, blurred vision, spaced out and felt extremely distant and depersonalised, I was told it seemed like an after effect of my throat infection and things would improve and was given sleeping tablets, I returned home unsatisfied with the result but positive and hopeful things would return to normal. They didn't and I returned multiple times to little success, or further prescriptions of sleeping tables etc but I didn't feel like they were taking it seriously, The GP consulted a Neurologist and I was told there was nothing to worry about. My symptoms continued and in a state of desperate panic I went to A&E to seek further help, I was given a CT Scan which came back negative which was a huge relief and again was told it seemed like a hangover effect from being unwell but again I didn't feel this was giving me any answers, I returned home and continued to feel exactly the same. After two weeks of not sleeping, I slowly managed to fall asleep naturally again on and off which was a huge relief however since May 25th, I have constant memory loss, I can't remember anything that happened five minutes ago or I feel like it was months ago, I feel constantly spaced out, dazed, blurred and like I have constant brain fog, I'm exhausted, I can't process thoughts, Or the thoughts in my head are suddenly non existent - The only way I can describe it. I have a constant light pain around the front of my head, I can't sleep, I can't function.

I don't truly know what has caused it, but I have had 5 conclusions before this year.\nThis fall I got another one in which I hadn't told anyone about until May, when I saw a neurologist about my worsening symptoms, short term memory loss, mental fogginess all of the time, not being able to concentrate on one thing for very long, he just told me to rest. I visited him a second time 2 weeks after the first appointment and lied about all of the symptoms saying they'd all disappeared, so I could play soccer again (awful idea). The symptoms seemed to level off, so I'm used to them now, but they are still very apparent, a new one though is slurred speech and stuttering. Drinking has most likely affected my brain in a very negative way, as I had been drinking with friends heavily (partying) almost every weekend. The past two months I have realized that emotions and characteristics of myself simply are not there. I don't feel like myself anymore. I can go out on the weekend with friends and pretend to have fun, but partying and having fun with friends doesn't really affect me.

   "comments": "Hi Taylor I'm going through something similar, here's something I typed a few years ago.\nJuly of 2011 I woke up with “Brain Fog” OVERNIGHT\nAwful Brain Fog that Impacted my sleep and memory. I can best describe it as having a blank mind all the time with horrible memory and no energy, lack of feeling emotions.\n2012 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety because of these symptoms.\nMemory was, and still is, impaired from what it was before July of 2011. Short-term is terrible, long-term is a little better than short-term, but still terrible. I don't experience headaches as often since it happened.\nSometimes get muscle twitches (left eye, legs, sometimes arms)\n(If I run a hot shower and put the stream exactly in the middle of my head, it slightly feels less “foggy”).\nEmotions dulled. Can't feel the full feeling of happiness or love. Over time, I felt anger and sadness more than positive feelings. Imagination is also impaired because I can't think of visual images well.\nSleep is severely impaired.\nCan't sleep at all without medication, due to racing thoughts, songs, and voices playing in my head that start to happen before I sleep.\n(Earlier my legs would always be restless).\nI was prescribed Seroquel because it shuts those thoughts down, which allows me to sleep. Sleep still doesn't feel as restful as it was, before July of 2011.\nIf I choose to sleep without medication, I won't fall asleep until it's past 4:00 AM. I'll wake up 3 or 4 hours later feeling highly alert.\nExcessive Sweating\nEveryday at some point, I sweat excessively through my hands and feet.\n(I was prescribed Klonopin to help with Anxiety)\nFeels like I've lost my personality\nloss of internal monologue\ncan barely remember what I was like back then in 2011\ndrugs taken over the course of having a blank mind\nprozac\nlexapro\nwellbutrin\nzoloft\nklonopin\nremeron\ntrazodone\nrisperidone\nseroquel\neffexor\nSurprisingly weed did lift it once.\nnothing has changed besides me sleeping at night with medication.\nReport\n2\nReply"

I'm 19 and I've pretty much been experimented on throughout high school with different meds like a guinea pig. I was completely fine before this \"blank mind\" happened. To be honest I'm sure that the blank mind is not caused by depression because I was pretty happy before it, however I'm pretty depressed now BECAUSE of the blank mind.

   "comments": "Hey I am a 20 year old male with similar symptoms. I went out drinking and got the drunkest I have ever been, I was throwing up and everything (only the second time I had thrown up from drinking) I felt bad for the whole week after. I was just really tired all the time and has some brain fog. Eventually the tiredness went away and I started going to the gym again but i realized I couldn't work out very long with out getting nauseous and dizzy to the point where I had to go home. The tiredness came and went for about 3 weeks until I got home from a 1 week vacation last week. The morning after getting home I felt very uncomfortable, anxious, nauseous and tired! That night when I went to bed I had a panic attack because I was wishing I could feel normal again and have had a depressed feeling ever since, I had suicidal thoughts but not to a serious degree. I get very nauseous and gag a lot and I feel just so over whelmed by all this! I got blood tests because I am a vegetarian and all my levels were normal although the doctor said my blood sugar was low but not low enough to be considered low. I barely go to the gym now let alone leave the house. University starts back up in september and i am freaking out because im afraid I wont do well in my classes because of this. I go for another doctors appointment with a new doctor in 4 days.\nReport\n1\nReply"

I've done so many blood tests, MRI, went to a sinus and TMJ specialist, & recently went to a doc that specialized in depression and he gave me meds. Both I reacted very badly to, the first one nearly killed me because I had an reaction to it. So I stopped taking them and scared for my life to try another. It sucks, bad. Cause you feel like it's never gonna end and wonder if you'll ever be yourself again. But now I'm trying healthier habits like eating healthier and taking my vitamins because I found out I was low on a few things, and they say if your low on selenium your more likely to have anxiety. So I'm taking vitamins including that and on a gluten free diet at the moment. Just to mark stuff off the list about what may be causing it. After my experience with the depression meds I'm just horrified to try more. The fact it really tries to change your brain... And I end up having all the side effects. Makes me feel worse. I'm very interested about how you're doing now, it feels great to know there's people out there that are experiencing the same thing as you are..

The whole time, this life destroying brain fog thing was an allergy to dairy. I also ended up with vertigo the last few months before we found out what it was. I had to stay in bed and could no longer handle busy places. Within two days of eliminating dairy, it completely lifted. So, if you (or anyone here with the same issue) haven't already, get an allergy test done. An elimination diet of common allergies is also something you can try, but sometimes we can be allergic to weird, unexpected things or the culprit happens to be a pet or mold growing in our houses.\nDuring the exploration of what was causing this, I had doctors accuse me of depression and anxiety, and one doctor actually told me they thought I might be delusional.

The day after, I woke up and I felt so much fatigue, my parents had called me out because they wanted me to see something and the whole time I felt as if I wasn't really there. I was just agreeing with everything they were asking me so that I could just go back to bed. I tried to play it off so they wouldnt notice... It was horrible. I slept even more after that . Then like around 6 in the afternoon or around there I got up and I was feeling better. I've noticed that around the night I usually feel better. The timing flr this was horrible because my XV was only a week and a half after. In the little gap of days between her xv and mine , it necer went away. I felt so scared and I was literally praying for it to go away. These oast days have been the worst of my life...\nSome symptoms ive been having are the following\n- I can't think straight\n- I can't remember things very well\n- I am struggling to feel emotion\n- Lately I have been feeling much fatigue\n- I cant hold or initiate a conversation very well because I feel as if I am not there or I just dont know what or how to say it\n- Sometimes when I speak I know what I am saying but I feel as if its not me saying it.\n- I have all the anxiety symptoms\nAnd it really just sucks cause I can't be happy. I can't enjoy the things I used to love doing. My life has gone down a drain and I feel like I would be better off if I just died instead of suffering.\nThis isn't the first time It happens, it happened back in 2013 , but this time it's worse. I recall that it happens more during the day and I am fine at night, and it's usually when I am in places with lots of light or in a store. I get this sudden freling whereI know what I am doing but it's like everything is going on around me and I get dizzy ...and there is nothingI can do about it. I've tried telling my parents and we went to the doctor but they told me it was just stress. This has been going on for two months, I don't believe it's stress. And my parents think it's just in my head. I've done a few research of my own which led me here. At first I thought it was anxiety because I always sort of knew I had that problem ...but it was never confirmed. When I went to my doctor she asked me if I have ever been tested , but I haven't . I've realized that this is much more than anxiety. And I am a very paranoid person. I just really eant to know whats wrong. I miss my old life. My friends. My family. The fun. I would really like to know whats going on so I can continue with my life.\nReport\nReply"

Mine goes like this: As time goes by first my eyesight will get worst following with hearing loss but while losing some of my eyesight, it got sandy like layer that is hardly to be seen screening my eye. after that I got an extreme fatigue that made me tired and dmg on my body doesn't heal faster even though I'm young. I got bruise easily as well. you could get bloated body for a long time. being dizzy and having foggy head following that you feel like your not in your body completely for 24/7 is like hell. no one knows how it feels when it get worst. you need to control your health no matter what and don't lose from it. well for now try to press you stomach area with your finger if it's painful press about 30 min not too strong a weak one is okey if its too painful. This is just basic pressure but it's just helps you a bit for now. try to find a real oriental doctor not the pro but real one as they have different technique, that's like incorrect and correct way. real oriental doctors know the real way. byw my english aren't that good even studying is like hell for me. after getting cure your speech will get better like before. you won't feel extremely scared and your depression degree goes to a lower level.\nReport\nReply"

He knows the right way unlike other oriental doctor but he still need experience. the reason why I'm telling you this is that I don't want anyone to suffer like me for a long years. I don't think anyone can handle it for a long time but the good thing is that they get scared than before so they don't kill themself. but you'll still get dull\nThe organ of the human control everything. And stomach controls mental but not the causes. just why I told you press there for now until you find your real oriental doctor for yourself. it takes time to get cured it get longer based on how long you got it. Even mental disordered can be cured by real oriental doctor if that person was normal before without any surgery done. Oriental doctor technique have been long gone as the king kills them if they don't work right. they only work for the king and gets killed as well. You see I hate korea or china for not letting any talented person to get born they'll just get killed, king is absolute and greed will grow. OH yeah I forgot to tell you you'll have upper back neck pain and later your lower back pain will get worst. well it could differ since I'm not sure if we're 100% same since How I eat and How I live differ so some symptoms can be different.\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "Hi taylor\n?I know its been a year since you posted but I thought I would throw my 2 cents in on your issue.\n?I had and sometimes still have the same thing going on and it was my thyroid and iron that was doing it. All my tests for my thyroid came back normal and everything. I thought I was going to lose my mind but I tried as I might but all the doctors said everything was normal. Yeah right. But my doctor who is female knew something was up. She knew I wasnt making this up or that I was not crazy as the (I have to say it-sorry guys) that the male doctors thought I was. She gave me some levothyroxin (which is a thyroid med) and I started coming out of the fog, But I also found that my iron level (which wont be tested for unless you specifically ask for it to be tested in your blood test) which I did and it came up that I had low iron which is also another factor. I had extreme brain fog, wooziness, lack of focus, I would get lightheaded here and there for a few seconds and need to sit down, I was so exhausted by 1pm that I needed to just lay on the couch or in bed and once I laid down I felt getting up was going to be a chore because laying there in the zone was all I wanted to do. My head felt fuzzy/foggy, my eyesight even seemed to get weaker and I finally got reading glasses. I started taking my meds daily with the iron and i started feeling so much better. Every so often I forget to take my iron for a few days (which is stupid of me) and the tiredness and brain fog comes back. then I start up again and all is good. I hope you found your fix. Sometimes your body just knows when something isnt right and it takes trial and error to find the fix. Good luck to you.\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "Hi .\nI have absolutely no idea how open people on here are to this kind of response. I just saw your post, while I was starting to research about this spacing out/Brainfogginess I am dealing with for the past four years now. It doesn't seem to be as intense as you experienced it, but I had my lows and they got very very close to what you're describing.\nNow just to warn anyone who's allergic to spiritual talk: do not read xD.\nSometimes my intuition speaks clearly, and in your case it is telling me: there is an emotional cause to your condition. More precisely, major grief that you haven't allowed yourself to feel yet... And a voice whispers that this might be a common cause. Also for me.\nThis \"grief\" might be so deep you have never had access to. This \"grief\" might have been triggered by that break up you mentioned.\nFor me personally, I've started journeying into my emotions more and more and as I uncovered emotions and memories, the brainfog and spacingout diminished slowly but gradually. It still IS present. I also know the root cause hasn't found resolution yet.\nTo give you a better idea of what I am talking about: I realised that I never actually made up my mind whether \"I wanted to live or not.\" Some part of me was not committed to life and thus it kept escaping reality through those symptoms, making it impossible or very VERY painful for me to be active.\nThen I had in my childhood repeatedly situations where I felt I had no way out.\nAround the age of 12, I for some reason wanted to runaway from home, taste freedom, taste my own individual sense of self, but at the age of 12 living where I lived, knowing what I knew, I felt I had nowhere to go. All there was left is to stay stuck where I did not want to be.\nThe brainfog and pressure in my head, the spacing out, and even how it reflects in my everyday life makes me feel very stuck. Stuck in life. Stuck in something...\nAs I said, I believe there are more emotions and memory for me to uncover, express and free. Also no sense of self, no idea \"what I want\", no direction, unable to decide or make plans are things I relate to this.\nFor some reason, this particular feeling only comes up around midday and afternoon. In the morning I sometimes am very clear, and at night usually as well. It just seems to reoccur every day around eleven/noonish until 4-5 pm.\nI don't know if this will possibly help anybody. And by all means, I did not read all the comments, and physical issues are just as probable. But I just felt called to write this right here.\nYou might not even see this message, others might, and maybe it'll inspire the .\nMuch Love.\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "I hate to tell you this, but I have lived with bipolar disorder for over 20 years, and now work in the mental health field, and this is quite exactly my experience of depression. You may need a medication for a while. Studies show that the most effective treatments are medication COMBINED with therapy and lifestyle changes. After a time, you can wean off meds; my experience has been that the medications helped to clear the fog so that I could do some serious work, processing things that had created deep stressors. I also made some very healthy lifestyle changes- which you have already tried without success. I think at this point, you have little choice but to try therapy and/or meds.\nI hate to recommend meds, because I know they can be difficult to accept, especially with all the bad press they get, but is what you are living with any worse than potential side effects? None that I've heard of are worse than that. Just make sure they don't give you Effexor. It's one fo the most effective ones on the market, but you will NEVER get off of it; it's like withdrawing from heroine. Just awful. And don't give up if a med isn't effective immediately. They typically take 6-8 weeks for full effect, and it can take several tries to find the right med.\nWeirdly, Effexor was the ONLY antidepressant that ever worked properly for me. Weirdly, AND unfortunately, because it's expensive. I've been able to wean off of most of my meds over the years, as I have done a lot of work creating coping skills, learning to manage emotions, and doing neuropsychological training. But I still have to maintain a VERY strict routine for stability, involving avoiding ALL substances (alcohol, nicotine, artificial sweeteners, even caffeine), regulating my sleep, exercising regularly, meditating/mindfulness, and being very devoted to my faith, which has been an essential part of maintaining remission.\nYour journey might not be so difficult. Bipolar is notoriously difficult to manage. Perhaps you will find an antidepressant, the fog wil clear up, and all will be well. I certainly hope this is the case. But don't stay in denial so long that you lose half of your youth to this illness. The stigma against mental illness is so strong, but it doesn't need to be. Many successful people suffer from these things at one time or another; just accept it, deal with it, and start working towards healing. It's very possible in this day and age. You do NOT have to live like this.\nReport\nReply"

If anything comes through that is challanging or out of step from any robotic reutine Im done for the day. Today, for example, I am trying to play some fallout 4 and I was ok until suddenly I felt a pressure in my head and I found it extremely difficult to play the game. My children were running around being loud but it has never been an issue before. So Id say, to answer your question, it has been ongoing since my Mono DX 5 months ago with occasional openings in the clouds.\nI will say though the over all trajectory is positive. I cant tell day to day that im getting better but I can tell looking back I am. I too will have more sound intollerance. I cant tell if its because my kids are kids or if im not sensitive but I found it harder to deal with.\nI think the best way to describe my concentration problem is before I got sick, I was able to sort of anticipate everything that came at me. If my wife was coming towards me, my brain would prepare for a conversation depending on what was going on at that time (dinner, kids things, etc). If my wife comes to talk to me now it feels so random and I have trouble tracking why or what she is saying. So I have to go over it slowly and sometimes twice.\nBe patient.

Or, at least, this may help others in this forum.\nSounds like many of you have a B12 deficiency.\nA few years ago, I found out I had B12 deficiency anaemia. It sucks. I spent about a year in a fog. I would be driving home from work at night thinking, \"Wow, I really should not be on the road right now...\". It was like living in a dream. Sometimes, I would wake up so exhausted that I couldn't keep my eyes open and would fall back asleep...until 7 p.m.\nAnyhoo, below are the symptoms of a b12 deficiency:\nextreme tiredness (fatigue)\nlack of energy (lethargy)\nbreathlessness\nfeeling faint\nheadaches\npale skin\nnoticeable heartbeats (palpitations)\nhearing sounds coming from inside the body, rather than from an outside source (tinnitus)\nloss of appetite and weight loss\nIn addition to the symptoms above, if you have b12 deficiency anaemia, you may experience the below symptoms as well:\na pale yellow tinge to your skin\na sore and red tongue (glossitis)\nmouth ulcers\npins and needles (paraesthesia)\nchanges in the way that you walk and move around\ndisturbed vision\nirritability\ndepression\nchanges in the way you think, feel and behave\na decline in your mental abilities, such as memory, understanding and judgement (dementia)\nAdditional symptoms include:\nsymptoms related to anaemia\nreduced sense of taste\ndiarrhoea\nnumbness and tingling in the feet and hands\nmuscle weakness\nB12 deficiency can be caused by dietary deficiencies (common with vegetarians and vegans), overgrowth of bacteria in the stomach (h.pylori, for example), absence of intrinsic factor (a protein secreted by cells of the stomach lining), certain meds (specifically PPIs), gut inflammation, amount other issues.\nI think you need a specific blood test to confirm a b12 deficiency. Mine was discovered on accident.\nIf you do have a b12 deficiency, you will need regular shots of b12 (supplements won't cut it at this point).\nGood luck!\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "Hi ElleJay84, it's good you point this out to people, since a B12 deficiency is much more common than people think (and doctors say).\nI have to disagree with you though on supplementation; sublingual tablets are at least as efficient as shots, and the good quality ones contain a form of B12 (methylcobalamin) which is much better utilized by the body than the one in shots (hydroxycobalamin).\nBesides that; shots are rather unpleasant and need a visit to the doctors office.\nNote: it's important to slowly suck the B12 sublingual tablets away, don't chew or swallow them, the B12 gets absorbed by the mucosa lining in your mouth.\nI used these tablets (3000mcg) for 6 weeks and went from serum levels of 151 to 402.\nBtw, adding methylfolate increases the restorative effect of B12 supplementation.\nReport\nReply"

Food changes and vitamin, mineral changes could help. Things such as taking adaptogens or something like holy basil lowers cortisol, omega 3 lowers inflammation, and B complex turns food into fuel. Taking meds such as antidepressants, sleep aid, blood pressure meds can increase inflammation and impair hormone function.

   "comments": "TaylorMason (and others)...thank you for this terrific thread. Keep us posted on how you are doing. I too am suffering from similar symptoms (for the past 6 months). There was about a 2 month break over the summer, but now the brain fog and heightened anxiety have reappeared. Like many of you, I wonder if it's the brain fog and \"spaciness\" that precipitated the anxiety, not the other way around. I was pretty stressed going in, so I'm sure that's a factor. I also have low testosterone, which for a 46 year old male, factors to some extent as well.\nMy question for the group: one of the annoying aspects of this \"fog\", which no doubt contributes to increased anxiety, is the OCD like behavior I have developed in looking up word definitions to ensure I am using them correctly (...and that I haven't forgotten them). It all started by having a moment of mental lapse when I couldn't exactly say was it was I was looking at. When this happens, fear and anxiety follows, and I start thinking (believing) I am losing my intelligence.\nReport\nReply"

  {
   "comments": "Carmen, thank you for your reply! I did get a whole bloodwork panel done for the allergist -- everything came back clean as far as the autoimmune issues. In addition, the other blood tests were also not alarming to my Endo either. T4 was 8.4, T3 Uptake was 33, Free T4 2.7, and TSH 1.87. All within the \"normal\" range, although I've been hearing that more comprehensive testing may be necessary to accurately diagnose hypothyroidism. One thing I do know is that my free T is low (275); it's normal for a male in his mid 40s to see this drop, but it shouldn't be below 300. So, there's testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), but my endo isn't totally enthralled with that idea right now since it would disrupt my natural T production. We'll see how that proceeds.\nAll I know is that when I'm in my \"worst\" state of mind, I feel like I cannot remember the simple things. This is what escalates the anxiety even further (fear!), which can cause me to look up 50-100 definitions just to ensure I know what they are. What is scary is at times I feel like I'm having to re-learn words and objects -- i.e. I don't feel like I truy knew them, or even if I did, I am thinking of them differently now. The awful part about this \"word hoarding\" is that there can be multiple definitions for certain vocabulary words, which we intuitively know, but when you try to hoard it all, it can become overwhelming.\nI'll give you a recent example. At the store today, I saw a gift item for sale: \"The essential Star Wars Collection\". Now, was \"essential\" in this case meant to say \"basic\" or \"fundamental\", or \"vital, necessary, important, etc.\"? I honestly had to think about that. I find it's this kind of ruminating that is driving me crazy. Self-doubt begins to creep in. Often times a word will pop out in a conversation (said by another person), or I'll hear it on TV/radio, or read it, and I'll have to think over what it means exactly, and if I would have been \"smart\" enough to use that word if I were doing the talking. Fear of forgetting.\nLately, I've been sleeping well at night. I spend the whole day \"getting better\", i.e. starting out in a low, depressed, sometimes anxiuos state, and feeling a bit better cognitively speaking before bedtime. But then the morning hits...which is when I'll start ruminating again.\nRight now I am on no anxiety or AD meds. I am taking more magnesium these days, on a Vit B complex, and have started taking holy basil.\nReport\nReply"

I've suffered with depression for roughly 12 years (it started when I was about 10 years old), I got diagnosed with anxiety when I was 14 yrs old, I've been on antidepressants for the last 3 years and they didn't help any of these symptoms but made my general mood better. The last 4 months have been brutal!! My brain fog has gotten so much worse, my memory has gotten worse (short and long term), time just completely passes me by to the point I am so glad I've taken thousands upon thousands of pictures and videos of my little girl as I can't remember any of it at all!!! My other health problems that have been diagnosed are as follows; coeliac disease, iron deficiency anemia, Gilbert's syndrome, a duplex kidney, migraines, chronic back pain, I also have terrible menstrual cycles (to the point when I was 12 I was so close to having a blood transfusion and my gp wanted to put me on the pill to regulate it a bit but my mum went mental and refused!) I've been on daily medications since I was 14 years old and sleeping tablets on and off, migraine tablets on and off, and 2 medications for my menstrual cycles!\nReport\nReply"

When I had the blood test in sept/oct I had been suffering for 3 weeks and docs had given me antibiotics to start with then and out of hours gp said EBV and to get tested by my gp but my gp wouldn't because they were convinced it was just a virus or that I needed to take more antibiotics! Then finally they did the blood test and all they said was that I have had it in the past but didn't currently have it. I have been advised to get all my blood test results so I can do my own research as the gp will say everything's fine even when it isn't! e.g. The last time I had my FBC my ferritin was 17 \"normal range\" is 14 to 150 or something like that so gp said it was fine however my dietician said that's still really low!\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "Very sensible to get your blood panel results, and other ones. I already have been doing this for 20 years and have built up my own medical record this way.\nThe ranges which are used in blood tests are fairly random: they are based on samples of the population, not on any scientific theory. Most GP's aren't aware of this.\nYou're lucky to have a sensible dietitian. Maybe you should consider gettting a sensible GP also. He seems to be the guessing kind, which isn't the one you need since you have some complex health issues.\nReport\nReply"

I thought only health professionals were allowed the results until someone recently told me on a Facebook coeliac group that they have been getting printouts of their test results for years!\nWhile my GP is a nice person as my gp I don't think he takes me seriously at all... I went to him telling him I thought I had depression for 4 years then I moved to another part of the country, told them for about 3 years then got diagnosed after I had my daughter as they thought I had post natal depression but then looked at my file and saw I'd been suffering like this since I was about 12/13 but to this day my gp won't entertain the idea that I have depression!\nHe tends to just guess what tests to do as well, every few months I go to the gp because my extreme exhaustion is getting on top of me and he does a blood test every time! It was just luck that he eventually tested for coeliac. And even though he put me on iron tablets 10 years ago and has prescribed them to me for most of those 10 years he still thinks my ferritin was fine at 17, yet I was on 644mg of ferrous fumarate a day at the time!\nReport\nReply"

I saw an out of hours gp when I was going through a really rough patch with my depression and he was so helpful, he even emailed my gp about what he thought would be a good option for me though my gp completely disregarded this and simply told me to just go to the local safe haven if I felt really low!

   "comments": "It's been a while since I've responded to this thread, though I continue to peruse the replies daily. I think we're all looking for the set of symptoms that mostly match our own, while in the meantime taking note of the insight and suggestions offered by those who have been going through at least \"some\" variation of what the OP has been going through (...which has been for quite a while for some of you). I appreciate everyone keeping this thread going, and for those of you who have taken the time to respond back to me regarding my situation. In a week (Jan 18) I will be starting CBT with a recommended therapist near me. I cannot wait; I would like to get some answers. I like others have come to accept the fact that stress and anxiety plays an integral role. This \"latst bout\" for me has been going on for 3 solid months now. I do seem to have more good days than not, but even on a good day, I'm continually self-scanning, and inevitably at some ponit during the day, I will find myself ruminating over something that may seem trivial, yet it reaffirms to me that either I still have issues that need to be dealt with (CBT) or there is indeed something going on cognitively speaking. I wake up every day testing what I know. I can have a good day when I'm going along and not thinking about it, then come across some inaminate object (like rigatoni pasta) that I could not recall. There aren't many, and they're pretty minor, but when it happens, that seems to set the anxiety in motion. Typically not the \"panic attack\" heightened anxiety that I had initially when this began earlier in 2016, and because of that, perhaps not the degree of \"fogginess\" that I once dealt with. Nevertheless, it's like a continuation of a bad dream. I haven't forgotten the date, the names of my kids, the way to/from work or the store, nor have I lasped in getting my work done. But this has nevertheless been disruptive, if not at time debilitating. I'm still looking up 25+ words a day, *mostly* words I already know, just to verify I am not losing my wit. Like I mentioned, all it takes to set the wheels in motion is to come across something that I could not remember what it was called. The other day it was a type of pasta, the day before that it was the top of a curtain set (valance). I get that I am more than likely not going through something more neurologically severe (the D and A words), however even if this is 'normal', I am certainly not dealing with it very well. I want to wake up and have it behind me, but like I said, something inevitably happens to trigger the next round of rumination in my mind. The problem with this \"vocabulary hoarding\" OCD is often times a word will have multiple meanings, which makes it tougher to hoard. Moreover, your initial interpretation of a word, which was okay for me for all these years, gets replaced by what the dictionary tells me what it is. This causes confusion. Look up 25 or so words a day for 3-6+ months, and it can get really confusing, especially when you hear a \"buzz\" word pop up in a conversation. And that's my problem. I cannot get through the day w/o hearing someone (even if it's on TV) say something that will make me wonder, \"hmm, do I know that word? Would I have used in in that context? Such a vicious cycle. Working rotating shifts doesn't help, I'm sure, however I have been getting plenty of sleep these days.\nIn terms of supplementation, I have been taking omega 3 fish oil, Mg glycinate, phosphatidlyserine, and 100 mg of 5-htp daily along with a multivitamin. I *was* taking 5000 IUs of vitamin D, and 1000 mcg of vitamin B12 (sublingual), however I have found that both of these, particularly at that dosage, makes me quite dizzy and (thus) really exacerbates the brain fog/confusion (which makes the whole situation worse). Just yesterday before going into work I decided to add the 1000 mcg of vitamin B12 to my regimen before coming into work. For the first time in several weeks, my brain fog was at least a 6-7 (out of 10), when lately it had been better.\nI am seeking more advice. I realize (again) stress and anxiety are instrumental with this (and in my case, probably OCD as well). But the fact remains I am just not what I was intellectually this time last year, and that is quite disconcerting. I would love to believe this is ALL in my head (\"making it up\", and that it's all due to anxiety, but the fact of the matter is I can look at a technical paper or a job resume I wrote last year, around this time, and am left wondering how the hell I could do so nowadays.\nThanks again all for the comments.

   "comments": "I’ve been reading some of your posts and it seems a lot of people are struggling with the same problem I am. I have this constant feeling of pressure generalized throughout my head but mostly concentrated in my forehead between the eyes. Somedays it is worse than others but it is almost always there and noticeable. I also have what I describe as “negative energy” for lack of a better term down my spine. It’s an uneasy feeling around the thoracic spinal area. Usually if the fog is intense in my head it’s not as bad in my spine and vice versa but sometimes (like now and why I searched google and found this forum) it is bad in both. Along with these symptoms I’m currently suffering with chronic fatigue (can sleep 9 hours and still feel tired), lack of stamina and motivation, trouble concentrating, poor memory and other depressive symptoms. I would say I’ve had symptoms of depression and anxiety since childhood but it all didn’t get really bad until almost exactly 4 years ago. I was dealing with extreme anxiety issues on and off for a year after the first extreme case of anxiety. During this time I did not have the feeling of pressure in my brain and spine like I do now but I did have very high anxiety levels and periods of extreme depression. My anxiety has decreased over time and now hardly ever experience extreme anxiety but I still get slightly anxious especially in certain situations.\nMy brain fog symptoms first appeared 1.5 years ago and since then it has been pretty much constant. It all started not too long after a bad mushroom trip. I felt absolutely horrible for a couple of weeks after the trip and also developed this brain fog that I’ve been suffering with. Since then it has been pretty much constant although there was a period of time this past summer where it was hardly noticeable at all. This was during the time I was hiking the Appalachian Trail. I was getting plenty of exercise all day every day, was in an amazing environment that I enjoyed being in (the wilderness) and had a group of hiker friends that I could socialize with every day. There were many days where it was hardly noticeable but I usually could still tell it was there. It was a lot better than it was previously or than it is now however. Towards the end of my hike my symptoms started coming back and I suddenly developed lower back pain (With no apparent cause. Also, still feel it every day 5 months later) and I had to get off the trail before I finished. Since then my depression and brain fog has been steadily getting worse. I have no motivation to do anything and feel really bad a lot of days. My mood still waxes and wanes but it seems like it’s bad more than it is good. I’ve been to the doctor and have had lab work as well as an MRI and everything came back normal. My guess is that these symptoms are a manifestation of depression/anxiety and you would treat them the same way you would treat anxiety/depression. However in my case I’ve tried SSRI’s (had to get off of them because they made me feel horrible), seen therapists, eat healthy and exercise, meditate, etc. and still experience the brain fog. The only time that it has improved since it began was for a couple of months while I was hiking. I’ve read some of the other posts in this thread and haven’t seen a single person mention completely healing their brain fog. This saddens me. If anyone has experienced significant improvement in their symptoms please give me some tips (or point me in the direction of someone else who already has).\nThanks for reading (and if you’re reading this you probably feel bad too. I can relate to your pain. I’m sorry you’re going through this and wish you well).\nReport\nReply"

I have 0 concentration or patcience either. I wake up every day feeling like I've been drugged whilst sleeping and I've woken up on some sort of acid trip.\nI'm just \"not in the room\" my body is but my mind and brain have vanished ? It's like I'm an empty shell, I can't feel any emotions or feel anything like my senses are numb.\nI honestly am living a life of hell, it's called Derealization/ Dpersonalizaton, and can stem from underlying anxiety issues.\nHowever I've been on medication, seen therapists, seen many doctors who are puzzled and say they can't help me.\nDoes anyone else feel spaced out / drunk / drugged 24/7. It's like I've been in a dream for over a year and I'm in a coma, nothing seems real it's like I'm imagining everything in my head.\nIf I pulled the car over in a nice spot , it would be the same as looking at a picture on a postcode.

   "comments": "First off I'd like to say I'm sorry that you're going through this. Secondly I believe that this is some form of depression. I felt like that since fifth grade and I just felt basically dead inside. I used to cry for hours everyday. It got to a point in ninth grade that i started crying during school. No idea why but I would just get this urge to cry and I would either have to hold back or end up crying for hours yet again. This year in tenth grade I met new people and they have helped me so much with it. I used to talk to multiple people about it but I felt so alone and like no one really cared. I was filled with so much self hatred and I had such a low self-esteem and I honestly just wanted to die for the longest time. The people I met changed that. I suggest meeting new people, and if you have a dream or a goal then start working on that without making any excuses. Do the stuff you love but add a twist to it if you're bored with it or if it didn't help. I highly suggest writing poetry. Write about your thoughts, your feelings, your desires, your fears, just write it all down. Also if you are not religious already I also suggests giving religion a try and going to God with your problems. If you don't that is okay I am just giving you suggestions that helped me. I was severely depressed for almost five years and I used that as inspiration for my poetry, and paintings and drawings. Working out also puts me in a better mood ik sounds crazy but once you get used to the pain it's fun plus beneficial. I'm sorry this is so long. If you are having thoughts of self harm or suicideplease talk to someone about it.\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "Hi, I'll tell you the short and then the long of my experience (that way people don't have to read a big long story if it doesn't relate to them). And I plan to copy and paste this to many forums if you see it someplace else (forums in regards to sleepiness, brain fog, spacey feelings, not being able to take a full breath etc). I promised myself I would post it to forums if I ever found something that helped me.\nThe short answer is, on a whim, I cut out gluten and it saved my quality of life. I cut it out for none-of-the-above reasons. I'm not a \"hippy\" whole foods eater...whatever you want to call it, and I'm not an alternative medicine person (although I'm starting to believe that you do need to think outside the box now at times). I just randomly wondered if it would help me for a whole other reason. I didn't research it alot or put much planning into it, I just decdied to give it a try. I am now a different person. It took about 4 days for me to feel exremely noticably better. It took a week or two to feel my fogginess and sleepiness go away!!!!... after years and years of wondering what it is that is causing it....sleeping too much?, sleeping not enough? etc. I even had a neurological sleep study early into this problem which showed \"excessive daytime sleepiness\" but they didn't know why. And taking away gluten did it!!!!!, which is not even the reason why I cut it out!!! Within a few days, I also noticed my shortness of breath went away. I had that problem as well, where I couldn't get a full breath in often. That dissapeared as well.\nI never got tested for celiac disease or anything like that, and I don't care to, because I know I can't it gluten!!! I never have cheat days because it's not worth it to me... but one time I accidentally ate it and I felt like I had to sleep and sleep and sleep. I couldn't sleep it off because I have young children, but it was a struggle to stay awake.\nFinally, it took a few months, but spacey feelings, more fog, balance problems, feeling off, .... it wall lifted.\nI can relate to what you wrote. I'm in my late 30s but I remember this starting in my early 20s. I swore up and down that I was more tired than other people. People brushed it off as \"everyone is tired...I'm tired too\" but I had a nagging pulling need to sleep. I had to think of ways to get a quick ten minutes in and it consumed me. I slept on lunch breaks too.\nThen in my mid-30s I had an episode of some sort that I am still not sure of.... ultimately they called it possible vertigo. I felt spacey, couldn't remember things, extra anxiety (which I do suffer from), off balance, tired of course, and more. It was a scary time for me. I wasn't sure what was happening. I had an MRI done, I saw an ENT, a neurologist, thyroid tested (which I would recomment you ask your Dr about)....everything came back \"normal.\" I spent time and money, crying in doctor offices begging for someone to think of something.\nIt wasn't until I cut out gluten, years later, that this got some relief. I white-knuckled a few years, trying to get through the day with the brain fog, and tiredness and balance issues.\nI don't know if you need to talk to a Dr (people with symptoms that I had should certainly ask their doctor in case they want to do MRIs and thyroid testing, inner ear, TMJ can cause things etc. That's important. But on many forums people said their tests always came back normal but they don't feel right. I'm still not perfect, because I think I have leftover anxiety after going through this for years. side note: I also got glasses which helped all this too. Needing glasses and having astigmatism can make you tired and off balance as well. So, getting glasses has helped me too!\nI'm not a Dr or nutritionist or gluten expert, but it has helped me more than I can say, to cut it out. Night and day, two different worlds. I even asked a doctor along my journey, \"should I consider food sensitivites?\" and she said \"no, I wouldn't go down that route yet\" and I wish I hadn't listened.\nI now know that what you eat gets processed in the gut which in turn affects the brain more that I ever really gave it credit for totally. I don't think people should cut out gluten if they don't need to. I know it's considered a trend and a fad but I truly can not eat it.\nI know it sounds really hard for people to cut it out but I have to say, I went into it really non-chalently and it wasn't that bad (I know people get angry when they read that comment because it's not \"easy\" to many people, but I just mean, it wasn't as overwhelming as I thought it would be for me). I just went into that first day thinking I'll just pick out what I'd normally eat out of the kitchen, and if it said \"wheat\" I'd choose something else. I didn't read about it and stock up with gluten free products. I just went product by product. You can still eat lots of healthy and unhealthy foods that don't have gluten.\nI don't know if this is your answer. I hope it helps you or someone somehow. Like I said I told myself I would post to forums if I ever felt better, because it's a difficult confusing lonely journey to try and figure it all out. Good luck!\nReport\n1\nReply"

At the age of 22, I am in the lowest of lows and I desperately need some help!\nHere’s my tale:\nAbout a year ago, a couple months after an extremely strenuous relationship, I began noticing that I was tired all the time…and all around, I wasn’t really satisfied. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed my friends, and activities…but life just wasn’t as bright and vibrant anymore after a month of noticing this ever-present fatigue, it got a bit stronger.

I have no context for time and I sort of feel like I’m just floating through life suffering.\nFor months I visited doctors getting tested by specialists.

   "comments": "Fellow fog-heads;\nIt is both comforting, and saddening to read so many of us share this boat. I personally, have been struggling with this for nearly 7 years. Not in its entirety, as it very much ebbs and flows.\nMost persistent symptoms include;\nHardcore Fatigue\nRecurrent infections/colds - I seem to pick up every bug out there\nDigestive issues\nRecurrent periods of nightly dreams (that are recalled clearly and sometimes unnerving)\nVisual flashes, haziness, blurring\nBouts of allergy type reactions\nHeadaches galore\nBody aches\nDreaded brain fog\nFeeling of loss of balance/dizziness\nRandom twitching in muscles\nPanic attacks\nAnd the list goes on.....\nI have however had moments of complete clarity, where good health seems to find its way back to me and it has only ever been so after a multi pronged approach. I've seen every doctor under the sun, multiple ED trips, and tens of thousands of dollars spent.\nFrom my experience, the key is identifying a trigger. In my case, I have now come to the acceptance that it is very much health anxiety. As a self confessed \"control freak\" I always experience a flare up of this \"detachment\" when I feel ill for some reason or another. If I contract even a simple head cold, I know that it's out of my control, and that does not sit well with me at all. Stress is another huge factor - again, beyond my influence.\nWhat I have found hat helps though is a mix of both integrated and western medicine, and some mental grit.\nMy first port of call is usually the docs, to get. Talked a b12 jab. This usually helps with the energy side of things, and is a bit help in reminding me that I can actually function - albeit not overly effectively.\nSecond stop - my upper cervical Chiropractor for a check of my atlas/axis alignment. If you have not already read up on the importance of this, I suggest you do so - it was very much a lightbulb moment for me when I did.\nThirdly - boost the probiotic intake, and eliminate anything known to make your digestive sluggish. For some this can be gluten (not in my case thankfully) but other starches such as potato are a big culprit for me. You know your body better than anyone else - so use your own discretion.\nAdd omega 3 + vitd, calcium and magnesium supplements. No one supplement will help without the use of the others.\nSwap out plain water for water with an electrolyte additive.\nAn adjustment to any discrepancies in sleep habits I found can help too. Same time down, and same time up - every day. Avoid napping at all costs.\nThis, mixed with an inner mantra of \"I don't have time to put up with feeling like this\" and refusing to accept it as the \"new normal\" has saved my sanity on multiple occasions. Keeping busy physically, quietens the mind.\nOn most occasions a couple of weeks of taking care of myself before anyone else (near impossible with kids) somehow re-sets the balance and lightens the brain load. This usually rectified things for me until the next stress bomb, or bout if unfortunate luck knocks me back down again.\nWhere all else fails, I opt for a prescribed antidepressant - but NOT an SSRI. My many trails with SSRI's have shown that the side effects can and often mirror the symptoms I'm tying to rid myself of. I will NOT advocate any particular product, but please know that there are more options out there - they're not commonly promoted at this time, but the results are impressive. No withdrawal symptoms, can be taken ad-hoc, and little to no side effects.\nIf there's one thing I've learnt from hundreds of doctors, is that I need to tell them what I want and why I want it. My confidence in their ability to identify, sympathize and treat this beast was shot to pieces many years ago.\nAll the best in your hunt for clarity!\nReport\n2\nReply"

   "comments": "I have this brain fog and many of the symptoms described here, it’s difficult. I self-medicated with drugs and alcohol for a long time. Skip 10 years. I began taking an anti-inflammatory recently with the active ingredient indomethacin. Strangely, it reduced the fog quite a bit, it was almost enough, the positive effects have reduced now. The point is it is cognitive, there are chemical balances in the brain which must be out somehow. I have had this for 15 years. All these psychiatric labels are subjective. The drugs you try, anti-depressants, anxiety medication, whatever….. it doesn’t mean that you have that condition, that condition is a label. The only way to approach it is trial and error, try different drugs and see how they affect the fog. I know that I am worse when I am under allot of stress, when I drink, when I don’t sleep and when I don’t exercise. It doesn’t matter if I do all of those things it is still there. I put systems in place for things that I do, so I can drift through subconsciously and still get things done. I write down my thoughts about a particular situation and read them over to re-enforce what I need to. Important not to surround yourself with people that bring you down, not being able to repond to a**holes quickly causes stress. If you have difficult family members, work out one sentence that to say to them to redirect the conversation.\nI don’t know if that helped anyone, good luck to us all!!\nReport\n1\nReply"

Unchartered in terms of symptoms and longevity. I mean, it's just something I never would have expected; it seems so surreal. I don't think any of us would have seen something like this coming.\nFor me, I have had some good days, and some not-so-good days since my last repord (around New Years). The anxiety aspect is under control (so it would seem). I am sleeping well. However, I could still tell something isn't right. My vocabulary is more simplified. I often have to think twice what a word means, or what an obscure object is called. I just don't seem to have the breadth or depth of working memory as I once did. Often times I resort to more basic terminology because the more complex terms don't come to mind right away. It may not seem like a big deal for someone on the receiving end of a converstation, but it feels like a big deal to me. I don't expect people to recognize a problem just because II said \"opposite\" because I couldn't remember \"antithesis\". Yet, I feel there's a problem. When I'm really in the throws of this \"brain fog\", I hear words and phrases that, while I know the meaning and can understand what folks are saying, I wonder if I would have used similar terminology...I wonder those words would flow out as easily for me without having to think.\nAt this point, IMO, I feel we're beyond anxiety and depression. I don't want to minimize the ramifications either can have on our cognative abilities. Then again, if this has been going on for 10 months now (hard to believe), and it's most likely not neurological, then what else can it be??\nOne day/one week we're fine, then a little stressful period comes up, and we're like this for 10 months. For some of you, multiple years. What the heck? What was the \"light switch\" that turned this thing on for good?\nOh, I am also on generic Anaranil (2 weeks now). Not sure I'm impressed at this point, since it seems to be making my brain fog worse. Let me be clear: if any of these ADs cause brain fog, then there's no sense in me taking them, since IF I do have depression, it's becuase of this brain fog, and not the other way around!\nReport\n2\nReply"

   "comments": "What are everyone's opinions on TMS treatments? My doc said with my symptoms of the \"brain fog\" dream state, not feeling really in the world are signs of depression but there are different types. Mine he says is from a tramatic experience and my brain went into shock and now won't come out of it. It stays in a dream state to protect itself but always waits for any little thing to happen... it's like on guard every second of the day. I feel completely normal other than feeling like I'm in a dream state 24/7. But also I do feel dizzy and sick a lot of times bc I'm tired of it been through this for almost 7 years and I'm just turning 21, this month. The TMS treatments (look it up for better understanding) are supposedly natural, but are waves to the part of the brain they say you need it (they do a evaluation to see how your brain works) to stimulate that part of the brain that wants to shut down. Supposely mine that is trying to shut down is my logical part, which makes you believe you're really here. And they say the TMS treatments will stimulate that part again. I like the thought of it bc for one it's natural, more than taking anxiety and depression meds that just make it worse for me, but it's still very scary bc it's dealing with the brain, what if it makes it worse?... also it's very expensive, around 10,000 for the treatments required. Hey if it really works it's worth it I'm not saying that at all, that would be priceless. But also what if it doesn't work? Thoughts? Bc I know most don't know about this, I had no idea they did this. Until I reached out to a health food store for possible natural stuff to take and she referred me to this.\nReport\nReply"

As others have mentioned, brain fog seems to be a type of Depression. The brain fog is caused by cytokines which are triggered from inflammation. I only know this because I suffer from an inflammatory disease and I have terrible brain fog. There are many studies about this online. I read that inflammation in depression is very very common. So you should definitely check this out. Unfortuneately there doesn't seem to be much you can do about this inflammation. Certain dieting techniques are available. Also they curently have medication like cimzia and humira which block specific cytokines in the body, but these medications are only available to people with autoimmune diseases like me.

I finally typed in a different way and you popped up like God let me find your post when I needed to see something that could connect me.\nLet me say I am so sorry about your suffering. Also let me ask you a question please, have you ever been given antibiotics called Cipiro or Leviquin or another antibiotic in that class?\nOddly e ough I have mental illness too before this started. I am a disabled veteran and have suffered with severe PTSF, anxiety, with some depression and mild form of OCD. Not sure about OCD. They just stuck in file because I can be very organized etc, not the hand washing or door locking stereotypes of that illness..\nI had 2 back surgeries in 2010 for degenerative disc disease that was creating jeopardy for my spinal cord and they fused 3 new discs. The problem actually started a couple of years before when the VA was throwing opioids at everyone so after surgery they'd course increased my dosage to like 90 Mgs a day of Oxicodone and Percocet. Overtime they kept increasing the dosageand it inched up to 165 Mgs a day. I don't remember much from 2012 to 2015 because I started sleeping more and more until I was barely out of bed for more than a few hours a day. All the time I knew this wasn't living but I was terrified of what I was convinced would be terrible pain all the time. I had even brought it up to several VA doctors that I was concerned that this type drugs were making me feel odd and not myself but they all wanted me to keep on them and the opioids themselves are evil in the way they make you believe you can't survive without them.\nMy point in telling you all of that is because I thought if I could get off of the pain pills I would be me again with what I had previously. Finally I had just left the pain doctor's office with 3 prescriptions and I feel God told me if I filled them I would be dead by that Christmas. That was September of 2015. I tore them up put them in a envelope with a note saying I am done and mailed them to the doctor' office. I then had to take something for withdrawals but to my shock I had pain but I could easily manage it myself.\nAt this time I thought ok, I should start to feel like myself in a few months. As you know I only felt all the symptoms we have discussed and I set out on a unsuccessful quest to find out what was wrong soI could treat it.\nYou know the rest of the story.\nSorry this was so long but I thought it might help you understand and maybe we could learn something.\nLet me know about the question I asked and stay strong.\nGod Bless\nAl\nReport\n1\nReply"

The brain fog, lack of focus and concentration is the worst. When I attend meetings I contribute very little, I'm deviod of ideas and cant think of constructive questions to ask. I never feel sharp or clear headed, every day is the same. A bit of history, nearly 30 years ago in my teens I used to smoke a bit of pot, when the pot first took effect everything would be clear and bright and I would feel great, then a minute leter I would get the brain fog and withdraw. I eventually stopped all together. Later I noticed the prescence of a dull headache at the top and towards the front of my head which has remained ever since, these days the brain fog and inability to focus/concentrate is the worst thing for me. Maybe the pot did some permanent damage, I was young and my brain was still deveoping, wish I could turn back the clock. If there is anything that could help sharpen my brain somewhat I would be over the moon. I too experienced anxiety issues, feeling down, negative which manifested 10 to 15 years later, I even went to a breathing specialist as my breathing was deemed to be contributing to the anxeity, the anxiety has improved over time somewhat but if only I could shake that DAMN BRAIN FOG!!!\nReport\n1\nReply"

These levels can have a huge impact on what you are describing and they are often overlooked during lab testing.

I've also had sinus issues recently and wondered if they are contributing to my raised anxiety state. I notice when the spaced out feeling is heightened and it does worry me - but I know it's usually when I need to catch up on sleep or have been a bit anxious lately. I will say that counselling does help, a doctor that you can connect with and some determination to distract yourself/stop worrying can really help. If anyone wants some advice, please get in touch\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "The last year of my life has been a brutal one. At the age of 22, I am in the lowest of lows and I desperately need some help!\nHere’s my tale:\nAbout a year ago, a couple months after an extremely strenuous relationship, I began noticing that I was tired all the time…and all around, I wasn’t really satisfied. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed my friends, and activities…but life just wasn’t as bright and vibrant anymore after a month of noticing this ever-present fatigue, it got a bit stronger. I would wake up each morning completely zombie-mode…and that feeling would remain throughout the entirety of my day, until my head hit my pillow that evening.\nInitially, I suspected some form of sleeping disorder. I set up a sleep study, got my thyroid checked, ferritin levels, all the basics. Sleep study revealed I sleep just fine and all my other blood tests came back negative.\nThe fatigue and the weight of the world slowly got worse over the next handful of months, UNTIL I woke up one morning and everything escalated greatly. I felt completely stoned. I couldn’t think right. I couldn’t concentrate. I felt inebriated. I felt totally disconnected and spacey. I felt as though I had no control over myself. I lost drive and motivation. I lost a lot of confidence. I always had an incredibly sharp memory. It was actually something well known about me to those in my family and friend circles. Yet, on this morning, almost all new information could not be retained. Things that happened earlier in the day, by evening, I felt they happened a day or two before. I could no longer recount the activities I took part in. This is possibly the worst of all the symptoms. The extreme short term memory. I have no context for time and I sort of feel like I’m just floating through life suffering.\nFor months I visited doctors getting tested by specialists. I visited a neurologist, infectious disease, I had an MRI, & I had about 20 different blood tests. NOTHING. My doctor literally said “I have no idea what this could be. I am beside myself” TOTES reassuring! I tried altering my diet entirely to organic and all natural. I continued my workouts and ran 15 miles a week. I tried sleeping even earlier. I tried all I could think of .\nI have scoured the message boards and found a few people suffering from the same, but without answers.\nI’m not sure if depression is the culprit, but depression sure has found its nasty venom-coated fangs into my veins. Tired, depressed, failed memory, no drive, scared…it’s no way to live. I want my life back.\nPLEASE OFFER INSIGHT! I will be so grateful J\nSincerely,\nTaylorsaurus Rex\n37 likes, 1041 replies\nReport\n37"

   "comments": "Hello everyone! It's been a while since I last replied to what is now known as the \"Taylor Mason thread\". How is Taylor doing, by the way? Does anyone know? I hadn't seen a reply from him in a long while.\nAnyway, I'm coming up to the 1 year mark -- when the \"brain fog\" symptoms began. I can actually remember the date (May 14th). It's been one hell of a rollercoaster ride since then; I wish I could say I have more insight than questions, however in having more chunks of \"good days\" lately, perhaps there's something there I can glean from.\nThe last time I experienced \"debilitating\" brain fog, with the anxiety and occasional panic (and insomnia) to go along with it, was in late October. Since then, I have had more good days than bad, however up through early March, I developed an equally crippling OCD that led me to spend hours every day looking up words (some with many definitions), write them down, and store for safekeeping as I continued to have this fear of losing memory and communication skills. It got better for about 3-4 weeks later in March and early April, then regressed again, only to get better (again) last week. Outside of \"thinking about it\", I have no idea what spurs this on. All I know is that the brain simply cannot handle the overload I was putting it through. I took generic anafranil for about 10 days in early March and late April -- couldn't handle the side effects, so I got off of it. Both times it was around 10 days; in neither case did I reach theraputic dose.\nI am having an appointment with a new Endo in early June. I still suspect there's some hormonal aspect to this for me (male, 46); my blood panel didn't show signs of hypothyroidism last time, though it wasn't as thorough as it needs to be. Otherwise, I'm just trying to eat right, suppliment with vitamins and Omega 3 fish oil, and try to maintain a solid 7+ hours of sleep a night. Working rotating shifts makes that difficult for me (especially midnight and early AM shifts).\nReport\nReply"

I only have the dream world feeling 24/7, get dizzy often, pressure in head, sensitivity to light, and because of that get anxiety from it because I know something is not right and wonder when it will ever go away. Other than the feelings above I feel completely normal. And it's been getting worse because I think about it more and more wondering why. I know they say not to think about it but it's easier said than done. You're living in it. My fear is taking more medications making it worse, like the few I've taken. (Almost died off one because I had some sort of reaction to it) I'm a single mom, and have responsibilities every day that I can't just shove to the side Bc of this. So taking meds not only makes it worse but I also have to work having all the side effects which is impossible. No one really had an input on what I said awhile back about TMS treatments, it's as natural as you'll get if you want to actually do something about it. But they don't know LONG term side effects because it's so new. So I'm just stuck. I worry if doing stuff to my brain, no matter if it's meds or TMS treatments, will make it worse and I know I can't handle it any worse than it is now. But then again I worry I'll spend the rest of my life like this if I don't take a chance. But both worries weigh equally. I just wish it would lift without actually hindering my brain.

Can you think back to any illnesses prior (within a few weeks or months before symptoms started)... just because one doctor says you do not have adult PANDAS doesn't mean they are correct... one thing I have learned is that doctors don't know everything and we have to be our own (and our childrens) advocates ...

   "comments": "This post is gonna be long, but stick with me as this could essentially help you figure out what's wrong with you.\nTomorrow will be exactly 4 years since these symptoms have started for me. When it first happened, it was so bad I was constantly in and out of the emergency room because I didn't know what panic attacks and brain fog were. I just assumed I was dying. I eventually got to a point where my doctors were just telling me it was generalized anxiety. I'm not trying to take away from what they're saying, but it wasn't anxiety and then the symptoms, it was the symptoms that brought about the panic attacks.\n3.5 years and 5 doctors later, I finally found someone who gives a damn. My doctor has run every test you can imagine. I literally at this point don't even know what he can check anymore. The worst of it was a vitamin D deficiency and a slight b12 deficiency. The vitamin D deficiency has already been treated but because of the terrible brain fog, the vitamin b12 just makes my body feel like it's going haywire at even the smallest doses.\nI keep fighting because I know that something is wrong with me outside of a mental illness. In my struggle for answers, I have tried just about everything that doesn't require medication. Exercise, changing my diet, sleeping more (pfft that's a joke), and meditation. And not the breathe and relax kind of yoga. Guided deep Reiki meditation. They're great for the anxiety but don't do anything for the brain fog. So I kept searching.\nI started seeing a chiropractor because of the constant neck and shoulder pain over the years that I was told was caused by being in a constant state of anxiety. My chiropractor is actually really good at what she does and recommends that everyone get an x-ray before she starts adjusting them to see what the problem is (this is not to boost sales or whatnot, she literally charges $40 for the X-rays). So this was actually my second go around at this particular place. She is a longtime family friend of my aunt and when I was younger had terrible back pain (developed early). My mom took me to see her because she wanted to prevent anything bad happening later on. Currently, my x-rays are the same as they were over 13 years ago. I had an atlas (c1) subluxation and axis (c2) subluxation which is essentially your bone slipping out of it's correct position. The curve in my neck is almost non-existent as it was 13 years ago as well but I didn't pay it much mind. I figured it just caused the neck and back pain.\nFast forward to about a week ago, I go to my doctor telling him essentially \"thank you for all your help but I'm still feeling pretty crappy\". He asked what was up and I gave him a written list of symptoms (my memory is shot so if I had to recall it from memory I probably couldn't). A few of the things that alarmed him was that exercising made my brain fog worse (I felt more spaced out and detached right after instead of feeling good like I'm supposed to) and something else that I can't remember right now. He said it sounded like I wasn't getting enough oxygen to my brain. To anyone else that probably would be alarming but to someone that has had 0 answers in 4 years, it was FANTASTIC news. I took this news and did more research.\nI found out from my doctor that inflammation in other parts of your body can cause inflammation in your brain. I have rheumatoid arthritis and have had it since the age of 11. Yeah, sad. But I though it was weird that it would effect me over 11 years later after my RA diagnosis and to this extent. I'm 26 now for good measure. RA diagnosis was at 11, anxiety/brain fog started at 22, and I was diagnosed with the subluxations at 13.\nI went back to my chiropractor after that appointment and she gave me some literature on how the a1 subluxation can effect your body. Google \"atlas subluxation symptoms\" or something of the like and holy moly you're gonna be shocked as to what can happen to your body when this bone is moved. It basically pinches the nerve and cuts off the single to the nerves from there down (it's literally the first bone in your vertebrae) and your body tries to keep functioning but doesn't get the correct signals so it kind of goes haywire and does whatever. This also causes your fight or flight system to go crazy (panic attacks out of nowhere for me). The lack of oxygen to the brain can also cause... DING DING DING! Brain fog!\nSo I did a little test. I went to the chiropractor for 4 days straight and was going to go so for two weeks (they're closed on the weekends and I took a day to rest since I also get massages before hand and too many can make me sore). I started feeling better. My headaches and head pressure were lessened, I could do homework assignments (and college work requires SO much reading), and I was able to go out with friends (something that was really difficult to do because of the detached feeling.) This week I haven't gone yet and it's been 4 days since I've been and I feel like crap again. Not as bad as when it initially started but back to the baseline crappy feeling. Brain fog is just making me feel bleh, head pressure is back, and I am pushing forward.\nLike many of you, it started out of nowhere for me. THIS I can remember like it just happened. It was THAT terrifying.\nI was sitting in a computer chair in my living room with my fiancé and our close friend. They made a joke and I started laughing and tossed my head back (it was really funny) and when I brought my head back up, my heart started racing. I thought I got light headed and tried to shake the feeling but it wouldn't go away. I walked around the block a couple times thinking there was some excess energy (it felt like I had too much coffee except I had stopped drinking coffee then since it made me sleepy). Nothing helped. It kept getting worse and I thought I was dying so I was rushed to urgent care where the doctor pretty much hinted that I had done some drugs but didn't want to admit it because my mom was there. I was an adult at that point and am actually very open with my mother but he said \"yeah, everyone says that\", and I realized he wasn't going to help me. He sent me home with an antihistamine and Zoloft. When I brought the antihistamine to my doctor, he was so shocked at the dosage for it that he ran out of the room to make sure there wasn't a mistake and literally came back saying \"he was trying to drug you.\" Not very reassuring and I stopped trusting doctors after that, refusing any and all medication. I even told a pushy doctor once that \"if you give me medication, I'm going to sell it!\" That ended that.\nSo here I am now. Lots of money for testing later and somewhat of an answer. It wouldn't hurt to see a chiropractor. I've heard stories of people who got that bone reset and after almost a decade of exactly what we're experiencing (years of testing that tells us nothing, weird symptoms, and anti depressants that do diddly squat), had IMMEDIATE relief with all of the symptoms lifting right after. The experiences vary though. Worth looking into and you won't waste your time with all of these doctors and unanswered questions. With my subluxation being there as long as it has, it can take upwards of a year to correct. I have opted to do it the slow and steady way since some people who have had the bone reset by a specialist sometimes get worse. Like I said, the experiences vary. I feel like with my mini experiment I have made some progress and will continue to go as long as I can. Please feel free to ask any questions that you have!\nReport\n5\nReply"

I read about a patient who had a subluxation but it was waved off by her doctor as nothing. Her chiro was the one that assured her that this was causing her problems. Chiropractors specialize in bones (amongst other things) essentially, so they do a better job of finding things like a subluxation. Even bringing this information to my highly intelligent doctor didn't really seem to strike anything in him and he's typically very adamant about finding something that could essentially help me.\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "Today was my first adjustment by a Maximized Living chiropractor and WOW. So much information. In the past I've asked other chiros whether or not my spinal issues were causing my symptoms and I'd get a \"I mean, maybe\" and when you're paying for the visits, you kinda want more answers. A typical day for me is waking up, feeling kind of groggy, eating almost immediately because I can't tell when I'm hungry until my body reaches the point of FEED ME NOW, and dragging myself through the day for no reason really because I'm not working right now from all the issues. I also have a sort of baseline anxiety and all over pain that lingers always. After my first adjustment, I could move my shoulders around pain free (my neck and shoulders are ALWAYS killing me; it feels like the day after a workout), I could bend and reach things without pain in my neck, I could, and this may sound weird to most people, hear things better around me IMMEDIATELY after he places my c1 in the right spot. I usually hear things in the same room as if they were outside or on tv or something. Everything sounded like it was in the same room. I hadn't eaten because I didn't have time but usually like I said I can't feel the hunger building anymore. On the ride home, my stomach started growling which was a refreshing sensation for once. I also got sleepy like I wanted a light nap. With my anxious feelings, I couldn't nap if I wanted to and if I did, it wouldn't end great. I got home, made a nice breakfast, and went to bed without a problem. I usually have to coax myself to sleep on top of everything else. I can't just lay down and go to sleep. My father woke me up a little over 2 hours later when my mother in law arrived at my house and I realized I slept without interruption for the first time in YEARS. Even at night I'm waking up almost every hour on the hour. The chiropractor told me I'd feel a difference tomorrow, but today is going really well. My x-ray discussion is tomorrow (whoopee!) where he will explain my issues. Yesterday when I went initially to do my consultation, he had told me to wait 5 minutes and he'd look over some X-rays I had done earlier this year. 30 seconds later he came back in and said \"I don't need to see anything more\" and proceeded to ask me if my chiro told me I had scoliosis to which I said no but I knew that (from childhood, although my chiros never mentioned it to me during my current course of treatment). This guy explained all of my spine issues (and there are quite a few) and has more to tell tomorrow! I'm nervous but excited and hopeful as he said my body is reacting well to the adjustments and I'm still fairly young, but too young to be living with these issues at 26.\nSorry for the long post but as a long time skeptic of anything ever helping me, I'm now a hopeful believer that we can fix this fast!\nReport\n2\nReply"

At the age of 22, I am in the lowest of lows and I desperately need some help!\nHere’s my tale:\nAbout a year ago, a couple months after an extremely strenuous relationship, I began noticing that I was tired all the time…and all around, I wasn’t really satisfied. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed my friends, and activities…but life just wasn’t as bright and vibrant anymore after a month of noticing this ever-present fatigue, it got a bit stronger. I would wake up each morning completely zombie-mode…and that feeling would remain throughout the entirety of my day, until my head hit my pillow that evening.\nInitially, I suspected some form of sleeping disorder. I set up a sleep study, got my thyroid checked, ferritin levels, all the basics. Sleep study revealed I sleep just fine and all my other blood tests came back negative.\nThe fatigue and the weight of the world slowly got worse over the next handful of months, UNTIL I woke up one morning and everything escalated greatly. I felt completely stoned. I couldn’t think right. I couldn’t concentrate. I felt inebriated. I felt totally disconnected and spacey. I felt as though I had no control over myself. I lost drive and motivation. I lost a lot of confidence. I always had an incredibly sharp memory. It was actually something well known about me to those in my family and friend circles. Yet, on this morning, almost all new information could not be retained. Things that happened earlier in the day, by evening, I felt they happened a day or two before. I could no longer recount the activities I took part in. This is possibly the worst of all the symptoms. The extreme short term memory. I have no context for time and I sort of feel like I’m just floating through life suffering.\nFor months I visited doctors getting tested by specialists. I visited a neurologist, infectious disease, I had an MRI, & I had about 20 different blood tests. NOTHING. My doctor literally said “I have no idea what this could be. I am beside myself” TOTES reassuring! I tried altering my diet entirely to organic and all natural. I continued my workouts and ran 15 miles a week. I tried sleeping even earlier. I tried all I could think of .\nI have scoured the message boards and found a few people suffering from the same, but without answers.\nI’m not sure if depression is the culprit, but depression sure has found its nasty venom-coated fangs into my veins. Tired, depressed, failed memory, no drive, scared…it’s no way to live. I want my life back.\nPLEASE OFFER INSIGHT! I will be so grateful J\nSincerely,\nTaylorsaurus Rex\n37 likes, 1041 replies\nReport\n37"

I found out the whole time it wa sa mild form of hypothyroidism that wouldn't show up until one day i fell asleep and didn't wake up for 3 days. Finally I been on meds since, however the culprit of it all, was GLUTEN. so gluten was causing my major focusing issues, memory problems etc.. I went to doctors for several years until finally someone figured out gluten was a big culprit. Wheats, oats rye malt barely and yeast. I was also allergic to a whole list of other foods that were foods i ate regularly. I changed my diet, to a mostly vegetarian, and vegan some days diet, and stayed gluten free, and it has helped me tremendously. Try looking up the grain brain. Grains,even if you dont test positive for gluten or wheat allergies, cause inflammation in the brain. and cause a whole sort of mental issues. Google, gluten causes brain problems, gluten causes adhd, gluten causes autism, gluten causes thyroid disease, gluten causes memory loss, or gluten causes dementia, just type those in, and you'll be shocked. Gluten free has helped me alot. But i still have issues because i still eat too much junk food. WHen i fast i feel fine. Ever notice when we haven't eaten fora while we feel good? Well its the food! When your body keeps eating the same diet we normally eat, it dont get a chance to recover, when your hungry, or haven't eaten for an extended period you feel good because your body dont have the toxins in it. So the doctor that saved me was a little old man, endocrinologist who suggested i adopt a mostly organic hippicrates diet that is gluten free. and he said if im vegetarian that i might as well just toss the eggs and dairy. Found out later i was also allergic to dairy and as soon as i cut the dairy (i still have sprinkles of parm cheese for flavoring but) and just ate yogurt plainwith a bit of fructose sugar, (is better hte processed, processed sugar also causes inflammation in the brain, as does alot of food) I felt tons better!! Instead of cofee no i go for morning walks and take deep breaths. If you smoke cigarettes or weed, that's another trigger! and that is a HUGE one. so get off the cigarettes!\nReport\n1\nReply"

   "comments": "Greetings Fellow BrainFoggers!\nIt’s been more than 3 years since I posted this plea for help.\nIt seems like every single day I get a notification(s) in my email stating a user has posted a comment or sent a private message. Words don’t fully encompass my gratitude foe each and every contribution to this thread. I believe one of the most beautiful aspects is a group of individuals who have been struggling alone have been able to unite under one online roof to come bond. It’s nice not being isolated. Thank you to each of you for sharing your stories and experiences and helping one another cope.\nAnd now, a quick update from yours truly:\nAfter so much time and energy spent chasing and hunting answers with no resolve, I decided I would put all these symptoms on the back burner and attempt to pursue happiness anyway that I could find it. I met a lovely woman who I charmed and wooed and persuaded to date me. She is the sweetest girl I know with a heart of gold and unmatched empathy and understanding. At this time I also took a massive risk and left the comfort of a very secure /easy corporate job to hitch the solar bandwagon. I joined Solacity the largest solar provider in America as a door to door energy consultant AKA: salesman. (Glorifying, eh?)\nYou can imagine the fear in me at the time. With little energy and a lack of mental clarity approaching strangers on their door step to convince them to sign a 20 yr solar contract was a daunting objective. But, I knew a lot of money could be made and I was ready for a change. I aim to never let fear dictate my decisions.\nAfter a year and a half later and tireless obsessive hours, I was promoted to regional sales manager of a 15 man team. It was a blast. We were making a difference, working hard, and having fun. All the while, my symptoms of fatigue chipped away at me little by little. The job was extremely strenuous….the money wasn’t as good as it should have been and the door to door channel just wasn’t sustainable. Elon Musk the CEO of Tesla ( electric car company) purchased SolarCity and recently cut the entire door to door division, and I lost my job. Thank goodness, I was planning to quit the same day I got this news anyhow. (HELLO SEVERANCE!!)\nAfter 2 years of living together, I decided there were a number of factors that pointed at me staying with this amazing woman wasn’t the right thing for my life, so I told her we should take some time a part and pursue our destinies.\nSo the last few months have been a whirlwind. I’m currently serving at a restaurant so I can have a flexible schedule and make decent money. I am backpacking Europe with 3 of my closest friends in a few weeks and I have ambitious to pursue my greatest passion: Acting/Filmmaking.\nI am full of hope as the future unfolds. I will reopen the mysterious case of brain fog soon, but for now…I can’t let anything stop me from becoming who I was always meant to be regardless of suffering. I am wiser now…more empathetic…and I use my energy wisely because it is precious to me. No more wasted words…no more effort spent on meaningless things. It has helped me broaden my perspectives. As much as I’d KILL for a miracle…I can’t say that I’m not also grateful for this illness. It’s forced me to grow in ways I never could have otherwise.\nCheers!\nTaylor\nReport\n7\nReply"

   "comments": "Hello Linda! I wanted to reply to you as well as the OP.\nI first noticed these exact symptoms along with others in 2006 or so. My main two were the brain fog and a rocking back and forth feeling. Others were bothersome but I figured it was all linked to having a few drinks on the weekend. In 2010 the episodes became worse and prompted several doctors visits with the always normal diagnosis.\nIn June of 2016 my potassium fell to dangerous levels and I went down for severe heat exhaustion at work. Went to the ER and was prescribed potassium supplements and returned to my normal day to day. A month later I was driving home from a job in Oklahoma and became severely disoriented and barely made it to the ER. All blood work was normal and they said I was having a panic attack. This lasted for another three days with me barely able to make it home to Houston. Over the next month and several more doctor visits I was sent to LLMD and was diagnosed with Lyme disease. I found your bite story very interesting. We do not have the blandfort fly here in the states but have one called a black fly that is similar. I have had several bites from these flies over the years and remember a spot like that on my neck a week before my problem in Oklahoma. I would love to chat About what treatment you are undergoing.\nI apologize for my grammar but like everyone here I am in a really bad fog that I think has to do with the hurricane and low pressure here now in Texas. Look forward to hearing from y'all and discussing things that have helped!\nReport\n1\nReply"

   "comments": "Hi Joryt, I hope you are allright, since you are in Houston?\nDid your Lyme test show if you were infected recently or longer ago? I myself am not sure when exactly I got infected. In hindsight I had weird symptoms already before I was bitten by the fly or ticks (syncope, visual aura, palpitations etc.), but after that things definitely got worse quickly. Maybe I already was infected and had a weakened immune system and this was the stroke in the neck.\nHow are you being treated by your LLMD? I'm taking Lymax, a herbal formula, since a few months and it seems like I'm slowly improving, with the emphasis on slowly... I got rid of the 'anxiety' and the limp by now, which is encouraging I think, but my recovery isn't steady, symptoms wax and wane all the time but get gradually less over time.\nThere are no LLMD's here which I can afford so I have to find my own treatment. According to my GP and the lab he works with co-infections don't exist and I can't afford to do private testing, which is frustrating since I don't know if i should treat any. I will start with an experiment with anti-co-infection herbs soon, and see if it adds anything. Besdies that I'm taking a range of supplements like L-carnitine, B12, folate, biotine, high dose vit C, LDN etc. and I eat very clean and healthily.\nI hope you did get rid of the anxiety thing, it's quite a scary experience isn't it? And expecially if one doesn't know yet it is something biochemical. I think it is appalling how eager doctors are to call symptoms like these 'anxiety', like that is the end of the road. It is 'raised cortisol' or 'activated stress system', which could have a multitude of causes, either physiological or psychological, which they probably find to complicated to investigate.\nAgain, I hope you are doing allright and didn't get flooded. Please let us know how you are doing!\nPS Being foggy is the standard in here, so don't worry about that:-)\nReport\n1\nReply"

I had 3 tests all negative but this all started a few weeks after being bitten by a tick, now I have been bitten by many many ticks in the past because I hunt and never had a single symptom but after that specific one this all started but because I tested negative the local drs wouldn't do anything more. I've read and been told by others with lymes that it's very easy to test negative and still have it. The other thing is when I was treated with antibiotics for the lymes initially(before my test was negative) the symptoms cleared up almost completely but I was only on them for ten days when the test came back they didn't extend the antibiotics. So about 9 or ten days after I ran out of antibiotics the symptoms came right back.\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "Hello Tyler,\nI am posint on this 3 - year old thread only because you recently commented on it.\nI, too have been suffering from similar thing. It's been about 2 years and symptoms are getting worse as time passes. Symptoms are:\n-Emotional numbness (aka depression)\n-Visual changes (after images, trail vision, visual static)\n-tinnitus\n-headaches/ head pressures\n-anxiety\n-slow thinking\n-tiredness\n-brain fog\nIt is very annoying and I've been believing my illness to be \"Depersonalization/Derealization\". However, as you all may know, doctors do not prescribe to that diagnosis. They all say it's anxiey/depression. I realize there is really no point of naming this illness. Whether it be depression,depersonalization, anxiety, therapeutic methods seems to be similar and medication for them are very similar, as well. So, I am giving CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) a try now. If this doesn't work, I will maybe go with antidepressant/CBT combo. Have you had any success with either of them? or any other treatment?? Please give me some advice.\nBefore I close this, something worthy? to mention is... that I had done alot of psychedelic drugs in the past (LSD,shrooms, salvia, etc etc) and had some spiritual experiences and have seen ghostly/demonic beings even when I was sober. Really strange thing is that, recently my mother and her sisters went to see a really well known spiritist to ask some stuff about people around them. Apparantly, the spiritist was telling everything right about their relatives when only their first and last name were given to her. It really surprised my mom when she had mentioned my name, the spiritist started to freak out and started saying I have depression, problem with my vision, headaches, chest aches etc and they were being caused by 2 demons that are in my body?? When my dad heard about this later on ( he did not go because he does not believe in those things). It surprised him as well. BTW, my mother and aunties were inquiring about more than 15 people, and she only reacted so violently about me. Furthermore, my story was not told to any of my aunts prior to this, because my parents thought it to be shameful thing.\nI wrote the last paragraph because I thought it was interesting how I had \"spritual\" experiences in the past and had seen some bad entities myself and some spiritist tells my mom that I have demon oppression on my body and im having symptoms because of it.\nReport\nReply"

It feels like some kind of depersonalization. I wouldn't say it's cfs, as I don't suffer any physical pain or suffering.\nI can see myself interacting more \"automatically\" with people. Usually they don't even realise, and I can socialize with them. But as I said, I feel it's \"automatic\", like I'm not thinking what I'm doing or saying and I'm just watching what my body is doing. It's really complicated to explain.\nDoes somebody from here found a reason for this and a solution?\nI changed almost all my habits and diet, but it still persist. I see that this can happen even if I'm not drinking, and sometimes I'm not sleeping at all for a while and I'm not experiencing this. After all this time I still couldn't find the 'trigger'.\nReport\nReply"

Like most people I have plenty of responsibilities/priorities like my families wellbeing that prevent me from throwing my hands up and walking away from my current profession. Back to the topic at hand, I began noticing how forgetful I had become earlier this year and I knew it had something to do with my high levels of anxiety. As time moved on the condition progressed and the only way I can explain it is that my brain felt muddled. I couldn’t clearly think about anything nor could I find the drive to pursue something that I enjoyed as if it took much brain power. This feeling is intensified as I get to work. I worry about how long I can conceal this condition, how long until people begin to realize my lack of effort. I fear that I will have to resort back to anti-depressant medications to thwart off this feeling.\nReport\nReply"

If you have high blood pressure you'd be meds and prolly wouldn't think twice about taking them, so many times people think of this as it makes you seem weak or something but I honestly think this is like any other ailment. We just won the s**t lottery and have this issue and have to take meds, others have way worse going on. We're sick, not weak there's actually a website sick not weak, google that and it'll come up , if this forum has taught me anything it's that there is so many people out there dealing with this we have to change the stigma we have about this in our mind, if we just look at it as what it is, a health issue, instead of the typical taboo dark cloud that might help how we feel over all. I immediately thought I mentally broke when I started having these issues and I'm a former athlete who prides myself on being mentally stronger than most so at first it tore me up but the more I read and hear, it's literally just like I have high blood pressure or something if medicine will help I'll gladly take it forever if I'm back to my normal self again.

   "comments": "The last year of my life has been a brutal one. At the age of 22, I am in the lowest of lows and I desperately need some help!\nHere’s my tale:\nAbout a year ago, a couple months after an extremely strenuous relationship, I began noticing that I was tired all the time…and all around, I wasn’t really satisfied. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed my friends, and activities…but life just wasn’t as bright and vibrant anymore after a month of noticing this ever-present fatigue, it got a bit stronger. I would wake up each morning completely zombie-mode…and that feeling would remain throughout the entirety of my day, until my head hit my pillow that evening.\nInitially, I suspected some form of sleeping disorder. I set up a sleep study, got my thyroid checked, ferritin levels, all the basics. Sleep study revealed I sleep just fine and all my other blood tests came back negative.\nThe fatigue and the weight of the world slowly got worse over the next handful of months, UNTIL I woke up one morning and everything escalated greatly. I felt completely stoned. I couldn’t think right. I couldn’t concentrate. I felt inebriated. I felt totally disconnected and spacey. I felt as though I had no control over myself. I lost drive and motivation. I lost a lot of confidence. I always had an incredibly sharp memory. It was actually something well known about me to those in my family and friend circles. Yet, on this morning, almost all new information could not be retained. Things that happened earlier in the day, by evening, I felt they happened a day or two before. I could no longer recount the activities I took part in. This is possibly the worst of all the symptoms. The extreme short term memory. I have no context for time and I sort of feel like I’m just floating through life suffering.\nFor months I visited doctors getting tested by specialists. I visited a neurologist, infectious disease, I had an MRI, & I had about 20 different blood tests. NOTHING. My doctor literally said “I have no idea what this could be. I am beside myself” TOTES reassuring! I tried altering my diet entirely to organic and all natural. I continued my workouts and ran 15 miles a week. I tried sleeping even earlier. I tried all I could think of .\nI have scoured the message boards and found a few people suffering from the same, but without answers.\nI’m not sure if depression is the culprit, but depression sure has found its nasty venom-coated fangs into my veins.

   "comments": "Hi everyone.\nI've been suffering from this now from almost 3 years ago.\nIt has not been solved yet (forehead pressure, inability to sleep, poor memory, inability to retain knowledge):\nThis is what worked:\n-SLEEP. I dropped from school. I started trying to sleep as i used and as I needed to. In order to sleep, use:\n-MELATONIN. The best thing to sleep. Currently I'm taking about 15 mg of fast delivery melatonin and 6-8 mg of prolonged liberation melatonin.\n-TURMERIC. If you manage to get 8-9-10-12 hours of sleep, you're on the good road. Now I can sleep about 7-8. My simptoms are still not solved. Turmeric has helped me regain some of my brain. I cannot focus completely, but I used to not be able to even watch TV. I was not able to read or do anything meaningful. Horrible. I was so dumb that I don't even cared about my inability to do anything. In fact, I relate to quite a few comments in this thread. So, one of my best findings:\nI discovered that turmeric helps. I was able to 'eat' about 48 grams (1.69 ounces) of turmeric per day during some time, but take it slow, as it damages you (for example your stomach), and it can make you sick from anemia (it makes it harder to absorb iron, so take vitamins for that while you eat turmeric). It helped me a lot. When you eat turmeric the pressure on the forehead increases, but your cognitive abilities improve after. It does also improve sleep.\n-EXERCISE. I run about 9 miles a day, and that helps a lot with the symptomps too. Increases the blood that goes to the brain, and it helps you with sleep too.\n-SEEK HELP. You need all possible help. You will need 5-6 years probably to solve this (I don't really know if it's solvable, hopefully it is). My mental performance has gotten better in three years, but i cannot do anything else in life aside from focusing every single day in order to make sure that I'll sleep OK that night and that the next day I'll be able to get up from bed (which I'm not always able to do).\n-VALERIAN, URTICA DIOCIA (NETTLE) AND PASSIFLORA INCARNATA (PASSION FLOWER). those help with sleep.\n-FOLIC ACID (I recommend you eating legummes) and B class vitamins.\n-AVOID TOXICS. Parfums usually worsen everything. Try to avoid them.\n-IMPROVE YOUR DIET (vegetables, avoid onion or garlick)\n-DON'T GIVE UP. THIS IS THE SADEST, HARDEST PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH. MY BRAIN HAS IMPROVED, BUT IT SEMMS THAT I NEED MORE AND MORE THINGS TO KEEP IT AS IT IS, AND MAKE IT SLEEP EVERY NIGHT. If I don't manage to sleep the hours my brain needs, I'll only go to the previous situation, and that is bad, really bad.\nIf we don't act, I am very worried that we will end up with some kind of dementia. Please, be strong, keep the courage in. I know you deserve it. Convince someone how big the problem is, how big your brain has been damaged, seek help in your parents, tell the doctors that you're gonna end up on the streets, with an empty space inside your skull. Be dramatic if you need to, this is no joke. We need a lot of help, because this is not easy to reverse, and it won't do unless you put all your efforts on it.\nAfter periods of anxiety and stress, brain damages. There are parts that are 'easy' (with help of turmeric, exercise, and good sleep) to recover (by easy, i mean three years, for example). But the sleep... That's f*****g hard. My brain doesn't know that it should sleep at least 8 hours per day, so I have to make everything possible myself to make that happen. And when it does not happen, you just go run your 9 miles (the next day), eat your turmeric, and pray god that next night you'll be able to sleep.\nI'm seeking new ways to fall sleep in hope that I will continue to recover from this, hopefully something does work.\nGod helps us. Best luck to all of you.\nBlessings.\nPS: Please, if someone manages to solve this problem, I would be very glad to hear how did he/she overcomed it. Specially if there's something that is effective in making your brain sleep as it should. My need for melatonin, valerian, exercise, and all that has just increased in this years. And I cannot cure myself if my brain doesn't know that it has to rest in order to recover itself.\nPS2: Sorry for the tone of the post. I just didn't managed to watch all this people thinking that they're gonna die, or that they will end up with some kind of dementia. I come across this thoughts too, not too long ago, when I was suffering from anemia besides this problem. It's a really tough thought, and a very depressing one. So keep strong please. All my love and my support from here. Doctors have little clue about this. We should try to spread awareness.\nReport\n3\nReply"

   "comments": "My symptoms started a little more than three months ago. I had stayed up for 42 hours to write a paper during finals week, and after that I was never the same. I had felt that feeling my head only one time before: I had a really bad experience with an edible, and had way too much. It took two days to recover from and on the last day I noticed the fogginess in my head. I didn't even notice when it went away the next couple of days and never would have thought I would feel it again. This is my theory: we all for the most part experienced some kind of stress/trauma/anxiety before the fogginess came to be, and I think that the wiring of our specific brains are wired to either 1. protect itself or 2. They become so overwhelmed that they kind of shut down. I put my body through a lot of stress by staying up for almost two straight days and it makes sense that my brain would react this way. Only thing is, my friend endured it all with me and he is fine, as far as I know. (points back to us being predisposed to issues). I haven't noticed a change since the day it started, and I was diagnosed with depression shortly after. I recently saw a neurologist and was diagnosed with migraines. Migraines have no cure, only measures to be taken to relieve some of the pain. I am now on setraline (Zoloft) for the depression and fatigue, topirame as my daily migraine supplement, and maxalt and cambia, which are \"abortives\" and are to be used when my \"headaches\" get too bad. We all know this isn't a headache. I am just hoping this medicine works for me, considering this 'thing' has taken over my life; if it does, I will be sure to let you guys know.

   "comments": "Thank you so much for the advice David. I just bought a B12 supplement, which I think we all should do (the liquid you hold under your tongue and the swallow, which is the most effective form of absorption), and I am buying the turmeric today. I came across something kind of life-changing, or, at the least, something that provides a little bit more answers. Microglia is the immune system of the brain. They \"turn on\" and release inflammatory messages after a range of things including head trauma, unregulated blood sugar, inflammation outside of the brain (like an inflamed gut), and poor blood circulation to the brain. Microglia are extremely sensitive. When I decided to stay up for 42 hours, you can imagine that there would have been really poor blood circulation in my brain. So they \"turned on\". The thing is, once they are on, they continue to send inflammatory signals for the entire spans of their lives, causing all of our symptoms. Go to your neurologist with this information. Not only will they take you more seriously since you know this/took time to research, but it might incite some new form of treatment they hadn't thought of before. I just moved to a new city so I am waiting to get a referral from my primary doctor, but I am tired of doctors beating around the bush with me.

   "comments": "I can relate to this. I am 40yo, but since I have been a teenager I have had extreme morning brain fog. I never thought much of it, except that I really wasn't a \"morning person\" and more of a night owl. I can recall my mom having to start writing notes for me in the morning, because whatever she would tell me in the morning I would have no recollection of later in the day. For example, defrost the chicken when I get home from school. She thought I was just ignoring or disobeying her until she believed me I that I just didn't recall even having the conversation until she reminded me of it.\nI typically don't start feeling \"with it\" for 2-3 hours after I wake up. At work I have always had to wait to do anything that was important or required focus and concentration. I used to joke with my boss that I \"needed an hour of internet time\" when I got to work. Same thing in college, I always took classes that started after 12pm or whatever.\nI also have other symptoms which turns out are ADD - lack of focus, concentration, easily distracted, poor organization, etc. Those are present all the time, but for me the most concerning is my 3hrs of disorientation after waking up. I get good sleep (usually 8hrs) and have a pretty stress-free life...I don't need to set an alarm, can make my own work schedule, no kids, no pets, no major stress factors.\nI was never really hyperactive so as a kid no one ever thought to have me tested for ADHD. I was in gifted program and found school to be pretty easy, so that was another reason why my mom or teachers would have thought anything was wrong with me. But I have been diagnosed with Adult Onset ADD twice, but never took any meds for it. BUT I am just starting Ritalin today, so I hope that might help. Although, I don't know how that can help my issues I wake up with.\nAlso, I was constantly tired and was the king of naps. But I have always worked 50+ hrs a week, and everyone I knew was always tired, so I just thought it was normal. But I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism a few yrs ago, and since I started on Levothyroxin that definitely helped.\nLately though, the past couple months I have also been extremely unmotivated, feeling isolationist and not hanging with friends or family, very tired, and just kind of blah in general. Almost like how I was feeling before I started the thyroid meds, but I have had my blood checked and my levels are fine.\nMy Psych Dr. said let's start with the Ritalin first and see what happens... \"one step at a time\".\nI know people that wake up, jump out of bed and are hyper alert and fully functioning, and it is the biggest mystery to me.\nReport\nReply"

So, if you're using turmeric (being it in low doses, with some black pepper, or (and specially), if you're using it in high doses), make sure to supplement yourself with iron, B12 and B9 at least.\nOnce I stopped using turmeric (because of the anaemia) I tried desesperately to find a substitue for it (the pressure on the forehead, and the sleeping ability got worse), so the next days I used this:\n-Oregan. Increases GDNF (a neurotrophin) in your brain, because it has luteolin.\n-Lion's Mane Mushroom. The important one. Increases NGF (another neurotrophin) in your brain.\n-Brewer's Yeast. Contains inosine, which increases BDNF (another neurotrophin, the one that is responsible for turmeric benefits, and the best neurotrophin in my opinion).\n-Honey. It increases BDNF.\n-Apples. They increase BDNF. Important too.\n-Nuts and almonds. They increase BDNF, thanks to fatty acids (they have magnesium too, but that's another story).\n-Exercise, of course, and all stuff related to sleep, for sure.\nI followed that routine for some days and I got some relief. BUT, but, but:\nSince I didn't have the anaemia that was making me feel tired, I started to change my exercise routine.\nAnd I changed it so that, during the next seven days I will not only run 5 or 9 miles, but during that running time I'll do around 12 sprints or more.\nSo it would be like: running some hundreds of meters (decent/high pace), sprinting some meters, running some hundreds of meters, sprinting some meters, etc. (running, sprinting, running, sprinting).\nDuring those 7 days, I can say that I made some actual progress, and the pressure on the forehead did almost disappeared (I've been fighting with that for three years, and although it was way worse at some point, I kinda was expecting it to not last very long nowadays) in those days.\nI'll keep supplementing for anaemia (important advice for you, specially if you do exercise: if you have anaemia, or if the iron-vitamin B supplementation seems to help you, DON'T STOP taking them, because it will make you feel worse, and also I'm very guilty of that too).\nMy hopes are that this kind exercise will help me recover my sleep on the long run (hopefully after 4 months I could see some progress, I'm definetely praying God for that. Leap of faith here, of course).\nAnd that's it.\nI hit my foot with a chair, so I had to stop running for three days (I did cycling, but it's not the same), and symptoms remain pretty much stable with some help, so not totally bad\nPD: I wanted to ask some of you a favour. If some of this stuff is helping you, please tell me. I'm really interested in knowing if this is actually the right path, if I'm missing something, or if there's a blind spot that I'm not looking at. I will very glad to hear from some of you that turmeric (or whatever it was) helped you with the forehead pressure, or if it helped you sleep, etc. But also I've been researching a lot and I've become desesperately anxious about knowing if there's a solution to the sleep problem.\nI think the main part of the brain that gets damaged after periods of sleep deprivation is the locus coeruleus, which is very related to sleep-wake cycles, so that may be the problem.\nIn my research, BDNF and NT-3 (also NT-4 I think) seem to protect, maybe 'regenerate' (we don't know yet) this part of the brain. Increased levels of AMPc can enhance the effects of BDNF.\nSo I'll probably be trying astaxanthin (increases NT-3) and Forskolin (increases AMPc), and I actually already bought them. With BDNF I think I'll be fine with apples and exercise.\n(I've seen also that electropuncture may increase levels of NT-4, but I doubt very much I could get that)\nBut this is ALL I KNOW, nothing more, and, as I said, I'm actually desperate for answers.\nSo, if you have a similar problem, and you think that some of this is helpful, please say it. I definetely think that some of you have similar problems, so watching if turmeric actually improves sleep, if astaxanthin does actually help people recover, or if Forskolin does actually lends you a hand, then that would be priceless information for this thread (and for me too).\nPD2: The reason I think this new exercise routine could be more helpful, it's because it can increase your levels of IGF-1 (a growth factor), up to 771%. If IGF-1 has some positive effect on the repairing mechanisms of the brain, definetely that's the type of exercise you should pursue.\nAnd now, that's actually all. :'\nGreetings.\nPlease, keep strong.\nA hug from Spain.\nReport\nReply"

I had pretty much the exact same symptoms described here, all of which seemed to come out of nowhere. In my reading, I discovered the symptoms of mold exposure were pretty much spot on with what I was feeling. And sure enough, we discovered a mold infestation behind the shower panels in the bathroom connected to my bedroom. And after two days of sleeping elsewhere, I can say I feel pretty much normal again. The pressure in my head has disappeared and my energy levels have been back. Very relieved to discover it was not something more chronic. Please don't discount this possibility if you are experiencing these symptoms... Best of luck to all of you!\nReport\n1\nReply"

About a year ago, I was exactly the same - I would freak myself out to the point of panic if I couldn't recall every tiny detail of what I did every hour of every day, time just became more warped and one or two passing days felt like a week, which in turn even furthered the dream-Like perception of the bubble I was in...of this sounds anything. Like what you're experiencing, know that it does come back! I promise, I didn't believe it, I thought I was forever lost down the rabbit hole. the only ONLY thing that finally allowed me to put the pieces back together, was holding onto that faith that things would get better, 100mg of Zoloft and 1mg of clonazepam a day. I would say I have completely recovered at this point - THANK GOD! but it's kinda like this - once you see something you can't fully UNsee it - same with anxiety - you will always be aware of it now that you've had the experience, but you won't have the symptoms and fear attached to that awareness - I promise, you're not losing it, you don't have premature dementia or psychosis - you'll be just fine! You just have to stay positive, force yourself to do the things that terrify you and don't be afraid of getting the help you need for your brain to rebalance. Love you all!!\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "Just a thought as I have been neck deep in research on this as well, now just a little background as this may not apply to everyone, I have IBS that's untreated, looking at symptoms of IBS anxiety, depression as well as foggy feelings are all part of symptoms, how this is possible is because your gut biome and gut flora directly affect your mental state. Probiotics will help as well as changing your diet. You also have neurons in your gut which is one way it's all connected. Now as I stated, it may not be for everyone, and I've havnt put this into practice yet but I've literally tried a million other things with no help so I'm ordering my probiotics tmw and making an appt for IBS Monday and hopefully we will see if there is any improvement. I've read a ton of information and it all seems to point here as I have exhausted all other health issues that it could be that carry these same symptoms. Just try and map out how your stomach has been feeling over the time period you've experienced issues. Maybe you ate something different than usual or got sick at some point or taken a long term antibiotics or anything that could've killed the good bacteria in your stomach or anything related to that. Again just another option be sure to check all other health issues first but def look into this as well, or research gut neurons or Ibs symptoms. Anything like this.\nReport\nReply"

I learned about this too late but maybe you can benefit from it. Or maybe this is old news to you.\nReport\nReply"

I am so glad to report that today and this feeling, a life changing event and now its going away. I am now the happiest as ever now but a bit more knowledgeable. So in my situation it is chemicals. My body have been ingesting chemicals unknowing. I will not tell how this was being done but that what caused it for me. So Make sure you watch what you eat. Make sure you start cooking your own food and your cloths that you wear everyday Try changing your detergent. If you eat at the same restaurant many times, change it and stop eating at those restaurants as well. For me, a chemical was entering my system for only 1 to 2 days a week and through my cloths. Again, this is what happen to me and reading some of the people comments, it is exactly what I have been feeling. I am no health professional but wanted to let you know how I fixed this problem.

   "comments": "Hi Cody- My symptoms include feeling very spacey and dizzy at times along with pressure in the head. I also have visual issues that include floaters, light sensitivity and perception distortion. Also, intense lower back stiffness and pain, as well as feeling tired all the time. Initially I had flu like symptoms that would come and go. There were periods of time when I would feel better but the issues would recur. With Lyme, symptoms vary from person to person. The bacteria sets up colonies in different parts of the body and so the symptoms can be unique to each person. It took many years of being misdiagnosed and suffering before starting proper treatment. My LLMD said with \"neuro Lyme\" the bacteria in the brain causes a type of encephalitis, where the brain gets inflamed and starts to cause all the neuro symptoms. I probably have had this for many many years before being diagnosed. I have now been on oral antibiotics for the past 3 months and just started IV antibiotics a week ago and am seeing roughly a 40-50% improvement of my symptoms so far. Unless you catch it right away and treat it immediately it can't be eradicated from your body. You can go into remission, but there is no known cure at the moment, so you treat when the symptoms come back.\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "Hi Cody- That is why you need to see a Lyme specialist. They are called LLMD's (Lyme Literate Medical Doctor) It's a very specialized field. Most of the current Lyme tests are not reliable and only accurate about 50% of the time. LLMD's will diagnose based on your symptoms, not just on test results, plus they use much more specialized labs. You can go to to locate a physician or try to google one in your area (not sure where you are located). Another resource is Facebook, if you have an account you can join a Lyme group and ask members if they can recommend someone. The downside is most don't accept insurance, but there are some who do. I hate to say it but most regular doctors are totally uneducated when it comes to Lyme. I initially went to an infectious disease doc who said Doxy for 30 days and your cured.

At the age of 22, I am in the lowest of lows and I desperately need some help!\nHere’s my tale:\nAbout a year ago, a couple months after an extremely strenuous relationship, I began noticing that I was tired all the time…and all around, I wasn’t really satisfied. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed my friends, and activities…but life just wasn’t as bright and vibrant anymore after a month of noticing this ever-present fatigue, it got a bit stronger. I would wake up each morning completely zombie-mode…and that feeling would remain throughout the entirety of my day, until my head hit my pillow that evening.\nInitially, I suspected some form of sleeping disorder. I set up a sleep study, got my thyroid checked, ferritin levels, all the basics. Sleep study revealed I sleep just fine and all my other blood tests came back negative.\nThe fatigue and the weight of the world slowly got worse over the next handful of months, UNTIL I woke up one morning and everything escalated greatly. I felt completely stoned. I couldn’t think right. I couldn’t concentrate. I felt inebriated. I felt totally disconnected and spacey. I felt as though I had no control over myself. I lost drive and motivation. I lost a lot of confidence. I always had an incredibly sharp memory. It was actually something well known about me to those in my family and friend circles. Yet, on this morning, almost all new information could not be retained. Things that happened earlier in the day, by evening, I felt they happened a day or two before. I could no longer recount the activities I took part in. This is possibly the worst of all the symptoms. The extreme short term memory. I have no context for time and I sort of feel like I’m just floating through life suffering.\nFor months I visited doctors getting tested by specialists. I visited a neurologist, infectious disease, I had an MRI, & I had about 20 different blood tests. NOTHING. My doctor literally said “I have no idea what this could be. I am beside myself” TOTES reassuring! I tried altering my diet entirely to organic and all natural. I continued my workouts and ran 15 miles a week. I tried sleeping even earlier. I tried all I could think of .\nI have scoured the message boards and found a few people suffering from the same, but without answers.\nI’m not sure if depression is the culprit, but depression sure has found its nasty venom-coated fangs into my veins. Tired, depressed, failed memory, no drive, scared…it’s no way to live. I want my life back.\nPLEASE OFFER INSIGHT! I will be so grateful J\nSincerely,\nTaylorsaurus Rex\n37 likes, 1041 replies\nReport\n37"

   "comments": "TaylorMason, I started Google search with so many different keywords trying to find anything at all about what seemed to be called 'brain fog'. That took me to cognitive disorders and anxiety as a possible cause. I suffer from debilitating anxiety, severe OCD, ADHD, as well as audio processing disorder, to start with. I've been trying to figure out why I cannot wake up, after 7 cups of coffee -which only made my hands shake- and my adhd dextroamphetamine, and a lot of B vitamins. Nothing. I just end up falling asleep in my chair and dumping coffee on myself. I tried to see if one of my many bedtime meds was the reason. Nothing. And then there is that kind of spacey feeling like I'm not in the same reality as everyone else and I cannot communicate or interact with anyone. I have absolutely zero memory; I have stopped even trying. I don't even remember things like where or if my girls are working or in school, or what courses. I don't work and am on disability, and since I only have any human interaction (literally, absolutely alone and only my dog to ever speak to), other than couple days a month in bank lines etc, I also have no sense of time. Suddenly a week has passed and I have no idea what day it is. When I tried to journal what I did or felt or whatever, if I didn't write it down immediately figuring I'd do it later, I couldn't remember if or when or what I had done. I found some people describing some of what I felt. That was helpful by at least giving me the words to articulate what I was experiencing.\nThen I got to your post. It was 3 years ago, so I don't even know if you'll ever even see this. But maybe it will let anyone else going thru this too know they are not alone. When I read your post, every single issue was exactly what I experience and perfectly puts it all in words. And not different people different issues. But someone who knows exactly what I am dealing with!\nAnyway, now I have something to perfectly describe what I have been unable to get across. I never even thought of them as all being connected in any way, one 'issue' and not separate problems.

   "comments": "UPDATE\nI first posted here when i found this thread 9 months ago. I was looking for answers too, like it seems that so many other people are looking . I still don't have any solution but I have come across something that might be an answer. Something I can take it to my doctor and he might know about it. At least I'll have a place to start and won't get the usual responses about med side effects etc. In the last 9 months, my memory loss has gotten so severe that I don't even want to try and interact with other people beyond cashiers and bank tellers. I can't even remember what my daughter's jobs are, what classes they have etc. I stopped asking because they get annoyed and I won't remember anyway.\nI started seeing a new psychiatrist in January and he was concerned about the memory loss in particular. I have a lot of other issues I struggle with and I take a lot of meds. Some things could be attributable to the other conditions and/or my meds. Or all. Or something completely unrelated. But the bottom line is I basically can't function. I've come up with my own words for the two types of my days. There are the Real Days. These are the days without Brain Fog, when all I have to deal with are my my usual difficulties. Then there are my Zero Days, or Nothing Days. For me, these days don't count. For the rest of the world, they do. Time passes whether I participate or not. So if my rent is due on a Zero Day and I don't pay it, it's still late. I think one of the hardest parts is the fact that I'll never know which kind of day I'm going to get. Just to let you know here are some of the other issues we've identified so far. I say so far because just like Brain Fog, I start to search for answers and I come across these 'ah ha, yes that's it exactly!' descriptions, i can't even begin to say how validating it feels when random pieces all fall into place. and looking back, so many things make sence. They are real. And it's not like looking thru medical diagnosis and think I have brain tumors or cancer either. Quite the opposite. It's such a relief in a way. I can tell my doctors and not get written off as delusional and the like.\nA perfect example: Face blindness.\nIt's when you cannot recognize faces. I didn't know why, but I learned to tell people, \" I won't recognize you if I see you again. Don't take it personally, my brain just isn't wired that way\". And what often goes along with it is that I Don not have any mental 'maps' so I rely on landmarks. In a restaurant or campground etcwhen I go off to the restrooms, if I don't turn around and see which way I will go back, I'll get lost.\nOne more pieces to the puzzle. maybe someday there will be enough pieces that I can have a life, not this relentless battle just trying to make it thru the day.\nAnyway, in addition so far, adult ADD, severe OCD and GAD, bipolar, Audio Processing Disorder (APD) - throw in some fibromyalgia too.\nBack to Brain Fog. I had a complete workup by a neurologist. CT, brain scan and MRI, EEG and EKG, nerve conductivity tests, complete bloodwork ruling out Lyme disease, lupus, other immune system problems, vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, liver diseases . Other than slightly increases in brain activity due to anxiety/bipolar, everything came back normal.\nI sometimes have nights where I will get up to use bathroom and seem to be half dreaming. Not sleepwaliking because I remember it the next day. I'll think I'm in another room, or somewhere else, bang into things, and get lost. One night was really bad. I kept falling down and knocking things over, dumped ice cream, just pretty bad.\nI did searched on different words and finally got a hit. Its called Sleep Drunkenness. I also found the name of an actual condition that seems to fit the description of my Brain Fog.\nSLEEP INERTIA\nNormally, when you first wake up,\nYou have up to a few minutes of Brain Fog. Sleep Inertia is a condition is where it goes on for much longer after you wake. They say this can it can last for from 15 minutes or up to several hours. My symptoms happen to go on for the entire day. Unfortunately, most of the research so far has been concentrated on finding ways to prevent the problem , not on ways to manage after you wake up. They did studies on of things like seeing if caffeine helped, etc. There really didn't come up with any thing yet to help.\nBut I now have a place to start when I see my doctor and maybe he'll have some things I can try.\nReport\nReply"

This is by far the most terrifying thing I've ever experienced and I'm sure you're feeling a similar way.\nSome context, I have had these symptoms for about a year now. About three months ago, through various doctors appointments, it was discovered I had a mass in my sphenoid sinus. I found a couple of threads where the OP mentioned that he had a minor polyps in one of his sinuses.\nLong story short my ENT specialist decided to remove it, citing that he has seen some pattern that masses in sinus can cause the symptoms we're describing. He was probably about 60% sure there was some causation.\nA month after the surgery I still feel the symptoms but I think at a lower intensity. He had given me a three months to a year of recovery time so I guess that's expected.\nRegardless I'm not satisfied.

He literally had me feeling like I was going crazy and imagining thing's. And he would never do the thing's I was accusing him of doing. Even though everything pointed towards what I had been saying all along. He finally did the unthinkable and had our family literally torn apart. But during this time I noticed memory loss worse than I had ever had. I had depression, & anxiety. Never been diagnosed with it but I know because of the circumstances of the situation. Went on for intierly to long. I started losing focus, in a middle of a sentence I would completely forget what I was saying my mind just went completely blank. I have forgotten almost everything I've ever learned. I'm having to teach myself all over again. It's quite embarrassing. I can't help my own kid's with school work and home work. I feel like a failure. I'm always in a fog. At least when I learn something and do something every day consistently I'm fine. If I go on vacation for two weeks and come back I'm lost. Even when I look at something and try to write it or type it I instantly forget what I was doing or trying to write. And I had seen on here some one had said a leaky stomach I wonder if that could be it for me but I also have bad teeth in the back of my mouth and I wonder if that also plays a role. Plus, I also have a thyroid condition. I was off my meds for over ten year's during that time I have lost 75% of my hair thickness. I know that also plays a major factor at least I would like to think so. Because I have always had slight memory loss since I was in 6th grade. But it's truly worse than I could ever imagine. I also think it could be Alhzimers or Dementia. But I can't afford health insurance so I won't know or be able to find out. I wish everyone the best of luck. If you find anything please continue to share. Glad everyone could be so honest and forthcoming about their problems.

   "comments": "I don’t know if this applies to you or not but I’ve been dealing with the same thing and upon doing some research I found out that tooth infections or sometimes still having your wisdom teeth pushing on your others can make a difference. This is ESPECIALLY the case for the upper wisdoms. Lo and behold, I went to the dentist and 6 teeth are infected and my upper wisdom has a pocket so deep I HAVE to have that wisdom tooth removed. If you read up on how tooth infections and specifically wisdom teeth causing brain fog, you’ll find quite a few things. To get people’s actual experiences, I like to google “wisdom teeth cause brain fog” or whatever the search is and then end it with the word “forum.” I’ll try to find you the link I sent myself of a bunch of people who were going through exactly what we are and were cured by getting their infection or teeth taken care of. This can become a problem because basically the infection in your mout, if left alone long enough, can seep into your bloodstream and make your systems go haywire for no reason. And believe me, I went through a million tests including complete thyroid panels twice and a complete hormone panel, MRI, CT, etc with no avail. My doc said the teeth thing can definitely cause it but that’s not something he can test obviously. He’s not a dentist. He knows ABOUT the mouth and pockets and infection, but cannot perform the things necessary to diagnose all of that.\nI too went to every specialist and was told it was depression or anxiety and finally gave up and believed that was it. And to a point it is true, only something is causing the anxiety because I have literally no triggers. After a few months of therapy, even my therapist said she can’t figure out what would cause me to become depressed or anxious. If for nothing else, therapy has helped me to learn to cope with this magical illness. But definitely look into dental. I’ve been evaluated and am just awaiting getting my teeth cleaned and extracted.\nReport\nReply"

Cut out sugar and eat clean to clear up and take antifungals\nLiver Congestion - check out Andreas Moritz book and liver flush group on Facebook - this was the big turnaround for me - a once a month liver flush can have amazing results\nMagnesium deficiency - huge problem apparently and major cause of anxiety and other issues.\nResearch these and I hope they help you.\nDiet is a major part of the recovery - cut out all sugar and possibly wheat & dairy\nAlso check out what they call Damp in Traditional Chinese Medicine - similar to candida\nReport\n2\nReply"

One thing is clear from my research- there is a staggering number of people who have this disorder and doctors don't seem to be aware of it. With how hard it makes our existence, we really need to pool together and figure this out by sharing info and making this issue more widely known until a cure or at least a proper diagnosis can be found.

   "comments": "To everyone on this thread (there are so many of us suffering from these horrible symptoms):\nI’ve been following this thread for about 2 years now. My symptoms were identical to OPs and have been gradually getting worse for 4 or 5 years (I’m 25 now). I had all but lost hope for myself to pull out of this foggy, no-memory, depressed, lethargic, miserable existence.\nI’ve been on depression medication, anxiety medication, had MRIs and brain scans, the whole 9 yards. All with no luck and no answers in sight.\nRecently I had a couple revelations (thanks, Acid):\n1) I noticed how I had a strange...sort of head pressure I guess. It wasn’t pain, it wasn’t uncomfortable. It was just there, and I felt like I could pinpoint the spot within my head that it was most prominent: near the top of my head, and on the left side. It was most prevalent when my memory and focus were at their worst, they seemed to correlate. However, the revalation that recently clicked with me was that my TEETH felt...just, tight. No pain or anything, my teeth were just a little tight feeling, and probably had been for a long time (happening gradually to the point that I never noticed it). Turns out I’ve had 4 impacted wisdom teeth for the last 5 years or so. I had them removed a week ago and holy hell do I feel better...and this time last month I didn’t even know my teeth were a problem! However, I’m not cured yet, but my symptoms have surely eased a little.\n2) This one may be more applicable to all of you than some wisdom teeth. Apparently I’ve been living with undiagnosed adult-onset ADHD and I had no idea. I was a straight A student with no effort all the way up until about my junior year of college, when I first felt the fogginess coming in, and my mental acuity slipping away. Slowly I just couldn’t learn new skills as easily as I always could, couldn’t study, couldn’t focus, sometimes would be listening to someone talking to me and not be able to comprehend what they were saying, was severely losing my working memory and short term memory, felt like I was going crazy or getting dementia! I began to obsess over these symptoms for years! It has been destroying me to say the least. My recent revalation here was that it seems like all of this has roots in my inability to focus. If I can’t focus, of course I won’t feel present, of course I’ll feel foggy. If I can’t focus, of course I won’t be able to remember things because I’m basically not committing things to memory. It clicked with me that this sounds a lot like ADHD. I began to research adult onset ADHD and dammit the symptoms lined up nearly perfectly. I then began to read testimonials on Reddit (great resource, by the way) of other adults who had adult onset ADHD and began treatment, and was met with great results like:\n-I have my life back.\n-I’m excited about basic challenges at work or with learning new skills for the first time in a long time, rather than being afraid of basic challenges/responsibilities.\n-I can remember what I was doing 5 minutes ago, which was previously a struggle.\n-My internal monologue is no longer distracting and I don’t live in my head anymore, but I can live in the present instead. (This one really rang with me, my thoughts are so distracting from what’s going on right in front of me sometimes!)\nToday I was prescribed adderall, in conjunction with an anxiety medication (basically to help me “reset” my thinking/overthinking). I’m excited for the outcome and I will report back how the treatment goes.\nFeel free to message me if you have questions or whatever else; none of us should have to go through this nightmare alone.\nReport\nReply"

The only symptoms I have that you left out were \"sleep paralysis\" and \"hallucinations\".\nI have narcolepsy type 2, which was diagnosed from a sleep study called an MSLT. I had been to an endocrinologist, neurologist, rheumatologist, cardiologist, and several doctors without any luck. When I finally went to a sleep doctor, I described to him what TIRED meant (not just sleepy, but sleep that doesn't refresh, sleeping 5-6 hours at a time during the day), and right away he told me that he had an idea of what the issue could be.\nI hope this helps, again there are good and knowledgable sleep doctors and there are bad ones. Narcolepsy is said to affect 1 in 2,000 in the Unites States and that almost 50% of Narcoleptics have not been diagnosed correctly.

   "comments": "I’ve started neurofeedback and pmf therapy for my “brain fog/dreamworld” I got a brain mapping done and my results were said to be just as bad as someone having head trauma. The doc said when you stress or have anxiety for so long eventually your brain mapping will be like mine. One part of your brain draws from the other trying to protect itself and it messes it all up, actually making it worse. But the neurofeedback is self training, they hook you up on wires and it tracks your brain waves while you simply watch a movie of your pick, whenever your brain overreactes or gets off of the movie the movie flickers and the sound goes low. Training your brain on how it should be. The PMF therapy is a pulsed magnetic therapy and it’s basically like a hat but it’s not, and it restores cellular energy. Each training is 30 min. It’s the most “natural” thing out there for anxiety, depression, whatever they think “this” is. No major risks. They do it on seizure patients and pregnant women. I’m done with pills that made it way worse and spending money on other things that my results say are “fine”. I’ve had a couple light days but not a full relief of the brainfog, and my job is making it way worse right now so it’s been real bad lately. They say most feel a difference around 20 treatments and I’m on 13 now, total of 40 treatments. I’ve also had some tingling in the chest lately, which has nothing to do with the training, thinking it’s stress. Anybody have that with the brainfog? I just don’t like it. Seems like I’m getting more and more effects from “this” that I haven’t experienced in the 7 years I’ve had this. But just an update!

It is quite safe to say that stress and anxiety were deeply involved. I also experienced emotional trauma around this time as well that triggered emotional trauma from a past abusive marriage. I have always had high functioning anxiety and could tell when I was battling situational depression but it seems like during a period of extremely high stress and pressure combined with emotional pain triggered the brain fog / lack of motivation / memory loss, etc.\nThrowing another layer out there: At the point where it started I had been single for the majority of 4 years and severely lacking physical contact, sex, cuddling and love and any feeling of being \"protected\" which is a biological need. During a short period of dating someone that I was comfortable with and trusted I noticed that my productivity/motivation returned and my memory cleared up.\nI am wondering if serotonin/dopamine deprivation combined with high stress is causing our brains to go into some sort of protective mode that is a defense mechanism.

   "comments": "Anyone reading this forum should look into something called an Atlas Subluxation. This may not be the culprit for everyones issues on this forum, but it may be for some of you as I believe it's what I suffer from.\nMy symptoms- I had several years of varying degrees of intense anxiety, I've had really bad intercostal neuralgia as well, anxiety eventually cleared up but then I started to have random and severe episodes of vertigo, eventually that went away and then anxiety returned, then it became more severe brain fog, feeling like my brain is wrapped in saran wrap, and just can't think clearly and feel really weird. Some times I wake that way and it doesn't go away the whole day, and sometimes I wake and feel normal, but can literally do something like stand up or move a certain way and it will then be there the rest of the day. I've also had 2-3 times that I have made a movement and literally goes away and it feels almost like when you wake up with a dead arm and the blood and feeling flows back, but I haven't been able to replicate that or find any commonalities when it has happened. I've had mild to medium anxiety only occasionally with this latest stage of brain fog with only a few times of bad anxiety.\nI only recently ound out what I that this is likely a atlas subluxation, but interestingly enough in support, the 2 distinct periods of time when my symptoms made incredible progress for long periods of time were in very close proximity to chiropractic visits.\nI've been dealing with this for around 12-13 years, and had my symptoms go away for about 3 years, shortly after things had got so bad that I had trouble envisioning having much to look forward to in life, as it was torture and a struggle just to get through a single day.\nSince my issues have returned (for about a year now) after the long hiatus, I stopped believing that I was just simply going crazy for no reason, and stopped believing that there was no normal life for me, and have made great progress in understanding what has been destroying my life, and now I'm just biding my time until I can afford and locate proper treatment.\nI would be overjoyed if even one other person is able to get on the right track to properly diagnosing their issues by anything I have provided here, and if it's something else please don't give up and find out what the problem is and get better and hopefully you can help others that have your same issues that aren't able to turn to anyone to find answers.\nReport\nReply"

   "comments": "I think you nailed it. My situation involved years of unchecked stress and anxiety, combined with major life situation changes, and some pretty toxic relationships. I also was always very intelligent, and still am when I'm having a \"good\" brain fog day. I feel like over the years, I have gone from worrying about everyday stresses and things, and generally caring about the outcome of situations, to a point where my stresses and anxieties were overwhelming, and then finally over time, to a point of anhedonia and apathy. In the (increasingly rare) moments where I am preoccupied and actually enjoying something, the anhedonia and apathy, and partially the fog, seem to lift a little bit. I believe this is very much so tied to a self-preservation defense mechanism where your brain stops caring in order to stop hurting. :\\\nMy sister and I grew up in very poor conditions, through both neglect and abuse, which has probably taken its toll and manifested into anxiety disorder as an adult. We both have anxiety, brain fog, and have developed short term memory issues throughout adulthood. My current girlfriend had some borderline manipulative parents, and while not abusive, they still took their toll on her. She has some of these same symptoms as well, although not severe enough to be crippling, as it seems like it is for so many of us on this forum.\nReport\n1\nReply"

At the age of 22, I am in the lowest of lows and I desperately need some help!\nHere’s my tale:\nAbout a year ago, a couple months after an extremely strenuous relationship, I began noticing that I was tired all the time…and all around, I wasn’t really satisfied. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed my friends, and activities…but life just wasn’t as bright and vibrant anymore after a month of noticing this ever-present fatigue, it got a bit stronger. I would wake up each morning completely zombie-mode…and that feeling would remain throughout the entirety of my day, until my head hit my pillow that evening.\nInitially, I suspected some form of sleeping disorder. I set up a sleep study, got my thyroid checked, ferritin levels, all the basics.

I felt completely stoned. I couldn’t think right. I couldn’t concentrate. I felt inebriated. I felt totally disconnected and spacey. I felt as though I had no control over myself. I lost drive and motivation. I lost a lot of confidence. I always had an incredibly sharp memory. It was actually something well known about me to those in my family and friend circles.

   "comments": "I know this post is a few years old now, but if anyone is still here, I hope I can help. My history and symptoms were basically the same as everyone else. Used to have a sharp, focused mind, great memory etc. Around my junior year of high school, I experienced a load of stress from school, family, relationships and it was like my life was sucked away from me. I developed strange symptoms including:\nlack of mental clarity(brain fog)\nsevere anxiety, social akwardness always on edge\nterrible complexion(acne, eczema, dark circles under eyes)\ndigestive issues(cramping, bloating, constipation/diarrhea)\ndull sense of depression, apathy\ninsomnia, pounding heart at nighttime\naddictive personality\nfast forward a few years and I think I've finally found a solution. After some additional research, I discovered that many of my symptoms were characteristic of digestive disorders such as leaky gut, dysbiosis, and candida (yeast) overgrowth. Basically, our gut is home to trillions of bacteria which allow us to digest our food and stay healthy. After periods of chronic stress, exposure to antibiotics and/or toxins which are everywhere in our modern environment, and a poor diet, the bacterial balance of our gut can become disrupted. Over time, the good bacteria (probiotics) which are essential to our health are killed off and replaced with high levels of bad bacteria, yeast, parasites, and mold which wreak havoc on the gut, resulting in food allergies/sensitivities, chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and a cascade of seemingly unrelated problems. Even more interestingly, the digestive system is actually home to a large portion of the neurotransmitters which are fundamental to our mental clarity and emotions. When the gut is damaged, the entire body is thrown out of wack in a way which most doctors don't know how to identify. They run tests on the brain and can't find anything because they're looking in the wrong place.\nAnyway, I've now started focusing on healing my gut through a Biblical-based diet and lifestyle and the results have been incredible. My energy is gradually returning, my brain fog is dissipating, and i fell an overall sense of well-being. My digestive complaints are starting to ease up and I'm able to tolerate certain things which I never could before (dairy, nuts). For the first time in years, I finally feel like I'm healing. While I'm not yet back to my old self, I have a renewed sense of hope and I know that I'm going to get through this eventually.\nI know what its like to feel helpless with these debilitating symptoms, especially when no one seems to understand and they tell you its \"all in your head\", but I'm here to tell you that you don't have to live like this forever. The first step would be to google leaky gut. There's plenty of information out there for you to figure out if your issues are gut related, which I'm willing to bet they are (at least in some part). The next step would be to clean up your diet and at the very least eliminate all processed and refined foods as well as any potential food allergies/sensitivities which can cause delayed reactions. Do some research and start supplementing with a high quality probiotic, preferably SBO's (Soil Based Organisms) which are essentially beneficial organisms naturally present in whole, raw foods that were a major part of our ancestors' diets up until recent times with the emergence of processed and genetically modified ingredients. My last suggestion would be to find ways to relax and get rid of stress, whether its through yoga, meditation, prayer or whatever works best for you. Personally, I feel that my relationship with God has been the most important aspect of my recovery, and I truly believe that its through His grace that I am finally healing. Once you do this, you are likely to see some real results. Hope this helps!\nPeace to all,\nJY900\nReport\n1\nReply"

   "comments": "I’m in the same boat. I try to explain to my fiancé who works outdoors all day that I’m equally as tired coming home from my desk job. Much of the time I have to rewrite things because they sound so awful. The best way I can explain it is it feels like I am drunk with a cold ALL the time. Everything feels weird. I can’t explain it, it just feels weird. I’m exhausted, everything is achy, I can’t remember much (thank God my fiancé has an amazing memory). It’s more annoying than anything. Something someone said the other day struck me as I couldn’t find the words for it but it was basically: “it is as if I am looking at the world through a cheese cloth.” Anyone else experience this feeling? It’s like everything isn’t blurry but it’s not exactly clear. My spatial sense is all out of wack. I bump/run into things all the time because I have a hard time judging the distance. Everything is also not as bright and clear light wise. Like when you’re drunk. I’ve tried all sorts of elimination diets and while they sort of help, nothing happens to where I feel like it could be the culprit. I’m going to look back into chiropractic work because it helped me feel better in my body, albeit not much mentally. For me, there aren’t days of relief, more like moments. It may make others feel hopeless but I like to believe that it’s that small part of me that reminds me that I’m still there and everything is gonna be okay. Something to look into, though, if you haven’t already is a sinus infection. Sounds simple and stupid but hear me out.\nI’ve had waaaaaaaay too many tests to count. I’ve been dealing with this for 4.5 years and if there is a test, I’ve probably had it; including a full hormone panel, thyroid TWICE, and ultrasounds of my ovaries. I mean, my doc tried everything he could think of. He even managed to convince my insurance to pay for an MRI after they denied me initially. But the sinus thing is the only thing we haven’t looked into yet, but here’s why I have a hunch this could be it, if not part of it.\nLast year I was a mess medically. I was constantly in and out of the ER with chest pains (not anxiety related), pain in my ovaries, and this weird cough. My body also would not digest my food if there was any meat in it. It would literally just sit in my stomach all day. I went to the ER because I felt just awful and I was given an antibiotic for something (probably the cough), and from the end of the year up until the middle of January, I felt great. It was like nothing ever happened. I was on the Dean’s list, I was doing great in the following semester, drinking coffee (I couldn’t anymore because I became super sensitive to caffeine), and I was REALLY happy. No brain fog. Nothing was wrong. It was like it was all a dream or something. Then mid-January rolled around and it came back with a vengeance. That’s when all the intensive testing started. I believe that the antibiotic I took helped a possible sinus infection and that’s why I felt great.\nHere’s another reason why I have a hunch it is sinus related. I grabbed a neti pot because my nose feels constantly inflamed inside. I have no allergies whatsoever, but I always feel like I have a dry stuffy nose. No mucus. I used the neti pot for the first time ever last night and I had a lot of nose blowing afterward (nothing color wise), and today I wasn’t dizzy. Still had brain fog but I wasn’t dizzy. Or nauseous which is typically caused by the dizziness. And for a few minutes, everything looked “normal.” I’m back to the bleh feeling again, but I think I might be on to something. Just look up some info on sinus infection, sinusitis, or the like and see what you find symptom wise to see if it fits what you’re going through.\nSorry for the incredibly long post, but if I can help us all solve this problem, it would be amazing. We are all gonna get our lives back, we just gotta keep trying!\nReport\nReply"

So 2 ruled out 1 so I didn’t proceed. & I don’t feel congested, I never have a runny nose or any other sign I just thought maybe something wasn’t flowing through and making me feel like way.

Prozac helped me in the past but just for few daUs. I got mania for 2 months. The only thing that helps short time is to try forcing your brain into positive state. Fake thinking.

I believe the content is important. How can I resolve? Thanks in advance.\nFolks - I have a long-winded post that didn't get out, but, my recommended treatment is paced-breathing exercises at 5-7 breaths per minute, starting at five minutes per day. My recommendation is to dilligently practice every day and increase duration. There are a wealth of studies that support efficacy of practicing techniques like this, that have a scientific backbone. Cell phone apps exist that can assist this.\nThis technique costs nothing, and requires minimal commitment - and changed my life. My symptoms were very similar to the original poster. I have had a relief of symptoms since beginning this, for several weeks.\nPlease web search the following for studies, physiological background information, etc:\nHeart Rate Variability Biofeedback, Polyvagal Theory.\nPlease direct message me for further information as necessary. If you find the practice helps, please give time to confirm for yourself, and post for others.\nReport\n1\nReply"

   "comments": "Hi everyone. Just wanted to share my experience and share what I feel like can be done to get over this. The way i see it is brain fog is just a very tired mind that has gone into protection mode. We all do so much thinking and give brain fog SO much attention, and what people dont realise is that this is what makes it worse. This is the fuel. Being a sufferer of brain fog myself i know its hard to just try live life without thinking about it. But you have to! Dont fuel it. Live your life normally. Eat healthier. Exercise and most importantly FORGIVE YOURSELF. Dont be annoyed if you don't feel 100%. The great thing is it is beatable and fixable from anytime in life. So start now. Stop googling symptoms. Stop youtube binging through brain fog videos. Stop talking to people about it. Cut off the fuel it needs.... and start focusing on YOU. Hot baths, massages, yoga, breathing exercises. Distraction techniques! I know it sounds easy, but i know how hard it is. But we have a community here so we all know what youre going through. Good luck peeps\nReport\n3\nReply"

No brain fog, don't feel like I was run over by a truck in the morning when I wake up, no anxiety or depression since after about day 3, I have energy and motivation instead of feeling lethargic and uninspired.\nI'm not just going to assume all of my symptoms are gone this early on, but I'm definitely feeling all around encouraged. I'm also encouraged from reading that some of my body pain that I constantly have may go away as time goes on.\nAfter researching this subject for a while, there's definitely a lot of things that can cause bad brain fog, but if you haven't specifically had your Vitamin D3 levels checked then you should. My doctor had given me blood test before, but I had to specifically ask for this test as well as a couple of others that like lyme, b6 and b12 thinking that at least I was narrowing the field.

   "comments": "I’ve experienced symptoms very similar to what your describing and have tried all the things you’ve tried and spent years chasing a cure. Let me tell you what worked the best ....Doing everything in your power to get quality sleep. The sleep studies look for sleep apnea but I don’t think they can really gauge sleep. The only real gauge for sleep are those continual days you wake up feeling refreshed. I’m guessing you don’t wake up feeling absolutely refreshed very often do you? For me, getting quality sleep required major lifestyle changes including stopping all medications, no screens before bed, alloting more than 8 hours of sleep in case some of its wasted, practicing breathing techniques before going to sleep so I can fall asleep without being tense and thinking about other things, if I wake up with my mind racing practice meditating to get back to sleep once again. But it’s most important to know that there will be a point in time where you tried these sleep habits and it didn’t feel like it worked. This is a very challenging part of the process because it discourages you to keep trying to get good sleep. Don’t let it discourage you because there will be days where you will find victory in your efforts to get that sleep. Just like an Olympian disciplines their body for the reward, you must discipline your body for sleep to receive that reward of mental awareness once again. Try it. Let me know how it works out for you.\nReport\n3\nReply"

It all started when I went through a really bad divorce. The doctors all stuck me with all kinds of mental health issues. But that was 16 years ago. I still have all these weird symptoms but it’s worse. I feel like my head is very full and no more can fit, ears ringing, muscle aches, can’t remember peoples names, no concentration, and more. It’s been blamed on sleep deprivation now because I am clearly not depressed. I also am changing my diet and exercising. But now my concentration is interfering with my daily life. I am now 55 and very worried about Alzheimer’s even though the neurologist ruled that out. How have you made out and what have you done to help your issues.

   "comments": "I’ve improved my derealisation/depersonalisation.\nI suffer the same symptoms as everyone on here and in fact, so many people on this post have described it in a better way than I ever could.\nThe brain fog, spaceyiness, memory blips, word slurring, looking at my hands in front of me thinking they almost ‘don’t look real’ (if that makes sense). The environment seems far away, I feel robotic, I bump into things and move around differently sometimes, when people talk to me I can hear them perfectly but for some reason I just can’t take on board what their saying straight away. I get a very very very mild headache but more of a pressure/dull feeling in the front of my head. I have floaters in my left eye which appeared suddenly also and various muscle twitches (which have now all gone).\nYour all going to hate me for saying this as I know there’s a lot of denial on it - but disassociation issues such as DR and DP are textbook anxiety symptoms. People who suffer such strange mental and physical feelings simply can’t believe that it’s anxiety that is causing all of this! Who knew it could?! Well it can and it does.\nI though oh no I have MS, ALS, Parkinson’s, severe mental problem, metal poisoning, Candida, Lyme (which is rare here in the U.K. by the way). Every week there was a new cause but I couldn’t face the reality of the fact I had a panic attack followed by a month and a half of sleep deprivation (3 -5 hours of poor broken sleep every night - that’s a lot of stress on the body!).\nIve noticed there’s a trend emerging in 80% of these comments. The symptoms get described and then what gets mentioned within the post usually follows along the lines of - eg: ‘oh and by the way I suffered anxiety attacks when I was young’ or ‘I had a panic attack’ or ‘I was studying really hard for exams’ or ‘I had a break up’ or ‘I was ill’ or ‘after pregnancy...’ etc etc Anxiety is related and involved in all of these life activities. Even if you don’t know it you can be subconsciously anxious or ‘on edge’.\nAs a lot of you know, when your threatened or anxious the front part of your brain goes ‘on holiday’ as I like to say. It says ‘screw this, I’m having a break’ and it slows down to help ease the threat. DR m/DP can happen during the moment of fight or flight but unfortunately for some people (aka us poor lot) it lingers and leaves the brain in a heightened state of alert. Which makes sense as when I felt like this if someone dropped a pencil I’d jump 2 ft in the air and spin around wide eyed like ‘what the hell was that??!’ So yeah, heightened senses.\nLet me say this...\nIT WILL GO.\nYou have to train the brain.\nYou don’t hear success stories hardly on the internet of these forums because everyones quick to come here to type in their problems and ask for help but then when they feel better they forget all about the posts on the internet and don’t want to revisit them. So we’re left hanging with all these negative posts with no follow up so it seems it’s hopeless.\nAcceptance helps. Carrying on doing what you normally did before. Exercise, meet friends, cinema, dates, holidays whatever nothing bad will happen to you, DR and DP cannot hurt you or cause you brain damage.\nDiet. Eat a clean diet, no gluten, less diary, Vit D, Omega 3, B12, Magnesium Oil (or Glycinate for oral consumption) and lots of pure mineral water. Get enough sleep also, before 10PM if you can for 8 hours and get into a routine even on weekends.\nIt all helps.\nI haven’t defeated it yet (7months deep) but it’s eased off and I do forget it’s there most the time which I’m hoping my brain will relax more.\nReport\n4\nReply"

   "comments": "Gcut, thank you for your reply. Your definitely right about the fact that people probably feel better so they never come back to respond. I have been dealing with this since 1999 . I guess the length of time is what’s bothering me but on the sam not if I were getting Alzheimer’s I think I would know about it by now because it’s been such a long time. I am probably not as strict as I could be about diet, exercise and going to bed at the same time every night. It’s really hard as I am so tired. When I’m tired it’s easier to cheat on what I should be doing. I also have bad allergies and it makes it hard to breath. I was told I have sleep apnea but the machine made me more tired. I do have anxiety and I take clonazapam to fall asleep. I worry about taking it as meds like that can cause early onset Alzheimer’s. I took an exam the other day and got quite a few answers wrong. all do to reading and concentration. So that scared me as it was an easy test. I went over it and knew the answers it was stupid mistakes. It’s def concentration and paying attention which is difficult. You made me feel better though and I will push harder and get it together and on track. Thank you Dawna\nPs, I hope that you continue to feel better and as you do you write your progress once in a while and I will do the same.

   "comments": "The best advice I can give you as someone who has also been 3 yrs deep in this(started out of nowhere) been told anxiety is what it is which I have never bought as a diagnosis but that could be the problem also if they are right however get all your vitamins checked then change your diet and eat vitamins to give you what you need. Vitamin b and d will def make you feel like this is they are abnormal also get your endocrine system checked out that being even a little out of whack can cause a slew of issues, lastly if all that still doesn’t give you answers and you feel like it can’t be anxiety get your gut checked you may have not enough good bacteria and overall gut health many people do not know but in your stomach there is pathways which litterally affect every bodily function and system you have. That’s why celiacs and crones disease cause so many issues among other things. If all that isn’t an answer start reading on acceptance and meditation and exercises to keep your mind busy because more than likely if all that failed. it is anxiety and that’s something that if you wanna get over it completely can only be done within yourself find your reason why your are on edge and scared then think it through and figure out why and work on that there’s a lot to unpack there but if you google poor stomach health and the causes you will be amazed. I have just finished a year long research into all this and now started making a plan to combat it, there a supplement called total gut health which I ordered and will be starting that on Monday and hopefully it goes good and I can come back and let everyone know\nReport\n2\nReply"

No one could help. It’s been 16 years. I am now on a GF, DF, organic as possible diet and exercise of yoga and jogging. Sleep the same time every night if possible. No computer or phone an hour before bed. Only half hour of tv then lights out. All these things together really helped. I am sleeping better but not perfect but I’m feeling better.

I have up on western medicine for a bit, but found myself trying one last time to get some answers. Now I am waiting for labs and imaging to come back from elevated liver enzymes and an ultrasound if possible fatty liver or liver disease. I'm thinking, maybe this has been my reason all along. I was just tested for various forms of hepatitis. I've only ever been tested for Hep B so now I'm crazy anxious because my symptoms mimick... well everything usually. That's anxiety for you. However, I'm onto something else after I see this liver thing out. I've read a LOT about adrenal fatigue. I'm a zombie all day long despite sleeping all night, yet in the evenings I have a spike of energy as if I am finally waking up. I don't stay up late, though. Even though I feel as if I could finally get some things accomplished. It seems like you have been through the works in a western medicine standpoint. I would suggest seeing a Naturopathic/Integrative/Alternative Medicine doctor. Unfortunately they aren't usually covered by insurance. They can do testing to see if your cortisol is doing the opposite as it should through saliva. They can also track it daily, as well as your hormones over the course of a whole month. This is important because one blood draw only shows what is happening in that very moment... not over the course of a day or month. If You have had anxiety or other mood issues for a long period of time (like I have) then it makes very good sense that you could simply be experiencing adrenal fatigue. Find someone experienced with it in your area. Many doctors don't even want to hear about that term, but check out the evidence for yourself online. It could be *our* answer for this. My naturopath does not take insurance so I plan to take the tests for my hormones and adrenals after I see what this possible liver thing is. Tests (by saliva because it's more accurate than through blood). Good luck. I honestly feel you on this one. The chronic fatigue has been my biggest complaint time after time with doctors.\nReport\n3\nReply"

   "comments": "Hi everyone. We will all have our own methods and techniques to either ease or rid the symptoms of brain fog. Mine took me almost a year to understand and accept. It was all bought on by anxiety. Anxious of how I was feeling was breeding more anxiety. All this anxiety pushes our minds into a protective state.... brain fog. By almost distancing and phasing out reality, the mind is focused on itself. However as an anxious person, I was getting more anxious of this feeling as I didn't understand it!\nI have since taken on many lifestyle changes to help reduce. I can happily say my brain fog is at about a 5% level of what it was 1 month ago. I changed my diet. I started eating healthy green vegetables and cutting sugar and processed foods. I started meditating and prana breathing techniques. Controlled breathing to trick your mind into thinking \"hey if someone is breathing this slowly... can they really have anxiety??\". Having good night's sleep. 7-8hours a night. I also started taking multi vitamins during meals and magnesium tablets each night before i slept.\nThe main thing I did was ACCEPT it. I was no longer afraid of it. No more googling. No more searching. No more thinking. Life is too short. The amount of moments I missed or wasn't fully focused on because I was TOO focused on my mind and brain fog.\nBrain fog thoughts bad worry fuel more brain fog.\nJust remember. This is your brains way of trying to protect you from danger (ironically the danger is something you have manufactured in your compulsive thinking).\nCut the compulsive destructive thought processes and make positive changes to your life. :-) it worked for me.\nReport\n4\nReply"

   "comments": "I've recently emerged from a five year struggle with severe anxiety disorder and bouts of depression. Brain fog was hands down my worst symptom. I had short-term memory loss, difficulty following conversations, difficulty speaking/getting my words out, couldn't process information well, whether it be spoken or written, and many others. It got so bad, I feared even having conversations with people, even my family, wife, and best friends. I nearly lost my job because I was having such a hard time thinking and communicating. My marriage and relationships suffered. I basically became a hermit in my house. It was the most difficult time of my life.\nAfter years of searching though, I found the right help. I am not an \"expert\", but I can tell you what I have learned and how I found healing: Brain fog can, and is often caused by, an anxiety disorder. Chronic stress can change the way the brain functions. When we behave anxiously, an area of our brain called the amygdala sends a stress response to the hypothalamus, which then secretes stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol to specific areas of our body. These hormones produce an array of physiological, psychological, and emotional symptoms. This is commonly known as the \"fight or flight\" symptom. Stress hormones can impact the brain. For example, stress can do the following:\nMake the \"fear center\" of your brain - the amygdala more active and dominant, and suppress the \"rationalization area\" of your brain - the cortex. This is why when we are anxious, we are often more alert and aware of danger. It can become difficult to think clearly and logically. Also, stress can increase the electrical activity in our brains, which makes it harder to concentrate and can cause \"racing thoughts\".\nThe way I was taught to eliminate brain fog and what worked for me was getting my stress levels down. Brain fog caused by anxiety disorder is due to chronic stress. If anxiety has escalated to a disorder, your body can begin experiencing symptoms of stress and sometimes constantly. When I had my disorder, I rarely ever got a break from the brain fog. It was constant. It didn't help that I was a hypochondriac, and when I was symptomatic I would worry, which caused more stress hormones, which caused more symptoms, which caused more worry, and so on - it became a vicious cycle.\nThe solution to symptom elimination due to chronic anxiety is to reduce stress and frequently relax your body. When we do this, our parasympathetic nervous system becomes engaged, which produces a \"rest or relaxation response\". You can try this for yourself right now - this is what happens when you take a deep breath and let it out slowly. I was told to deeply relax my body twice a day for 15-20 minutes each time. I listened to audio tapes of guided meditations, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle relaxations. Other ways that help are listening to relaxing music, take a warm (not hot) bath with Epsom salts, get a good night's sleep, light to moderate exercise, get a massage, walk in nature or in the country, lay by the beach, and many others. Anything that is relaxing. I would highly recommend daily quiet times where you unplug and listen to a relaxing audio tape.\nIn time, symptoms will reduce, and eventually go away. I am the healthiest I've been in many many years as of today. It is such a wonderful feeling!\nHowever, if you are struggling with an anxiety disorder, your symptoms (such as brain fog) are just that - symptoms. They are not the root of the problem. I discovered that the root of anxiety disorder is learned unhealthy behavior. When we have adopted unhealthy belief systems, it influences our thinking. When we think fearfully, our body produces stress hormones. Too many stress hormones = symptoms of anxiety.\nI worked with a trained anxiety disorder therapist who was able to help me uncover my unhealthy belief systems. She specialized in anxiety (having overcame one herself) and truly understood it. I learned a lot about myself. I learned a lot of unhealthy ways of thinking when I was a very young boy. For example, I had major health sensitivities. This was due to my brother being diagnosed with stage IV Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma at the age of 4. He was given a 1 in 4 chance to live. I remember as a little boy being constantly worried about him or someone I loved or myself dying. Since this unhealthy belief/behavior was established (especially at a young age), it became an automatic way of thinking for me anytime I had any type of health issue pop up. So when I started to experience brain fog, I would worry about it, which just caused more stress hormones and made the brain fog worse.\nThese behaviors can seem instinctual the more we think about them. Our brains remember and learn through repetition and reinforcement and can establish things called \"neural networks\" when we think a certain way for awhile. The key is to identify your unhealthy beliefs/behaviors and work to change your thinking. When you begin to think in healthy, rather than unhealthy, ways, you will stop producing constant stress responses, which eliminates the anxiety disorder and all of the symptoms that come with it. Working with a trained anxiety disorder therapist was instrumental or me as well. I didn't even realize how unhealthy my thought life was until I was able to get a trained 3rd party to objectively assess me and point out my thought patterns that just seemed \"normal\" to me, because I didn't know any better.\nI hope this helps someone out there who is struggling! Believe me - I've been there. It was hands down the hardest time of my life!\nJordan\nReport\n6\nReply"

   "comments": "Everybody please take this with a grain of salt, but I was finally able to feel like my oldself again - I got rid of my Obsessive Compulsive tendencies. I was online every day and night reading these forum covincing myself something was wrong with me. I spent a few thousand dollars on office visits to find out why I wasnt feeling “normal\". Was it stomach issues? Candida overgrowth? Mold toxins? Of course, all the tests came back negative saying I was perfectly fine. “But, that is impossible!!\" Fortunately, a few things finally helped me break out of those 6 months of hell and nonstop anxiety. The first thing was a call from my Uncle. Hes 70 years old and has lived a very unhealthy life of sugar, cigarettes, and fatty food. What this made me realize that our bodies know exactly what theyre doing - we are proof of billions of years of evolution and our immune systems are extremely complex and resilient. I decided then and there that I am going to stop trying to “control\" everything and I'm just going to let my body operate on it's own because it knows what it's doing. The 2nd thing that happened was when I was in the public library and the “universe\" had me come across a book called “Is it All in Your Head?\" Which contained numerous true stories of people who had convinced themselves that they were sick. People who literally convinced themselves that they had Multiple sclerosis and became unable to walk or a lady who had a sanitizer accidentally sprayed in her eyes and she convinced herself that she was blind, when actually her eyes were just fine but she actually convinced herself that she was unable to see..after all the specialist doctor visits and test coming back negative her last doctor visit was to a mental hospital...the Final thing that brought me out of those dark 6 months of stress and “never ending searches for answer\" was a trip to see old friends in Austin. I drank a few beers, ate some not-so-healthy food, laughed, smiled, and finally realized that when I “let go\" and just let life happen I am happy again. I'm my old self again. The person I used to be. The guy that could take on the world and wasn't afraid of anything. So my final message is that sometimes if you want to find yourself and be happy again you have to “let go\" and just live. Your body knows what it's doing. If you convince yourself you are sick I gaurantee you will feel sick. If you stave yourself and are afraid of eating x,y &z your body is going to feel weak because it's not getting the calories it needs to give you energy. Unglue yourself your smartphones because sometimes the answer isn't going to be found on there...let intuition and instinct take over. You might find yourself smiling again.

   "comments": "The last year of my life has been a brutal one. At the age of 22, I am in the lowest of lows and I desperately need some help!\nHere’s my tale:\nAbout a year ago, a couple months after an extremely strenuous relationship, I began noticing that I was tired all the time…and all around, I wasn’t really satisfied. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed my friends, and activities…but life just wasn’t as bright and vibrant anymore after a month of noticing this ever-present fatigue, it got a bit stronger. I would wake up each morning completely zombie-mode…and that feeling would remain throughout the entirety of my day, until my head hit my pillow that evening.\nInitially, I suspected some form of sleeping disorder. I set up a sleep study, got my thyroid checked, ferritin levels, all the basics. Sleep study revealed I sleep just fine and all my other blood tests came back negative.\nThe fatigue and the weight of the world slowly got worse over the next handful of months, UNTIL I woke up one morning and everything escalated greatly. I felt completely stoned. I couldn’t think right. I couldn’t concentrate. I felt inebriated. I felt totally disconnected and spacey. I felt as though I had no control over myself. I lost drive and motivation. I lost a lot of confidence. I always had an incredibly sharp memory. It was actually something well known about me to those in my family and friend circles. Yet, on this morning, almost all new information could not be retained. Things that happened earlier in the day, by evening, I felt they happened a day or two before. I could no longer recount the activities I took part in. This is possibly the worst of all the symptoms. The extreme short term memory. I have no context for time and I sort of feel like I’m just floating through life suffering.\nFor months I visited doctors getting tested by specialists. I visited a neurologist, infectious disease, I had an MRI, & I had about 20 different blood tests. NOTHING. My doctor literally said “I have no idea what this could be. I am beside myself” TOTES reassuring! I tried altering my diet entirely to organic and all natural. I continued my workouts and ran 15 miles a week. I tried sleeping even earlier. I tried all I could think of .\nI have scoured the message boards and found a few people suffering from the same, but without answers.\nI’m not sure if depression is the culprit, but depression sure has found its nasty venom-coated fangs into my veins. Tired, depressed, failed memory, no drive, scared…it’s no way to live. I want my life back.\nPLEASE OFFER INSIGHT! I will be so grateful J\nSincerely,\nTaylorsaurus Rex\n37 likes, 1041 replies\nReport\n37"

   "comments": "Hello.\nI am experiencing some really strange things with my head. I have a little insight as to what is going on, but it requires an open mind. I have never had any sort of anxiety that changes my brain chemistry and I take zero prescription drugs. I have only had one episode of brain fog in my life that may have been caused by poor diet and too much sugar. That situation could have been a vitamin deficiency. However, this situation has been described as \"ascension\" symptoms and sickness. If you have been to doctors and had run all the tests and are still confused you might want to research this. As it was explained to me is that this sort of thing is an adjustment or upgrade allowing your body to become a light body. So, if you have not discovered any medical reason for this try to eat more vegetables and cut sugar from your diet as this may help. Anyway, I saw that you were a young person struggling with this and I wanted to reach out to you and present to you something that is a it \"out there\" but a lot of us are experiencing. Good Luck.\nReport\n1\nReply"

   "comments": "I was curious and just felt like I should bring it up.\nA) Yes, eating more vegetables can help.\nB) That being said \"ascension\" is purely holistic, and you should be aware that it has no actual medical backup outside of holistic medicine and putting these symptoms as a \"spiritual issue\" could be dangerous. Yes, many physical things can start with the brain, but please don't brush these off as a holistic issue without proper testing by a medical professional. Many \"clean eaters\" suffer from malnutrition. Eating clean doesn't mean you're getting all your nutrients! Know your macros, get ENOUGH clean protein, even if its not through meat. Unless you KNOW what you are doing with things like keto please eat your carbs, and if you are doing keto and the \"keto flu\" persists, then look into seeing a licensed nutritionist to get help with it or advice as to whether you should stay on it.\nC) A side note about veg, for people with sensitive stomachs you could also look into avoiding nightshade vegetables and the like. While they do not cause issues in most people, they can cause inflammation (as well as brain fog, fatigue, etc.) in people who already have chronic intestinal disorders. I recommend trying to limit them for a bit just to see if it helps.\nD) Through my years of having brain fog I've found other reasons can be: stress (extreme over long periods), other hormone imbalance issues (caused by everything from diet to depression), lack of exercise, being in an area where you don't get enough fresh air.\nE) All this being said, extreme brain fog can be signs on Lyme disease, certain types of poisoning (due to allergies or actual poison or mold), and other brain diseases so if it persists please see a professional!\nI know most of us have gone to professionals only to find little wrong, so why not try these other methods. You got this!\nReport\n1\nReply"

   "comments": "hi all,\ni began following this forum when i first encountered all of these same symptoms myself back in the summer of 2017. for two years, i visited countless doctors and have received multiple diagnoses.\nwell today i was informed that my bloodwork came back positive for lupus. now, i don't think you all have lupus, but i recommend you all get tested for it. i don't experience any of the skin flare ups, so i never thought it could be the culprit. it could explain the head and face pressure, as it causes inflammation. can't believe it took two years to figure it out, but at least i have an answer.\nover the last two years, adderall 15 mg and evekeo 5 mg has worked for me. the depression was a result of not being able to live the active life i was used to living, so instead of treating the depression, we treated the fatigue. it helped. it made me so productive and energetic, i almost felt normal. the depression and anxiety subsided. actual anti-depressants simply made me crazy.\nit's been quite the journey and ive learned a lot about myself and this collective condition/symptoms/management of it all these last two years. i managed to still graduate college a year early and im planning on going back for my masters. if you guys ever need someone to talk to about this, please send me a message. i remember how hopeless i once felt, and i'd like to help.\ni wish you all the best of luck,\nesme454\nReport\n2\nReply"

   "comments": "Hi everyone. I understand that everyone here has some kind of brain fog issue or they would not have found this forum. I myself have been suffering from the same issue, I gave it the name \"brain fog\" before I knew that other people used it too.\nBefore you skip over this post let me say that I found something that worked for me, this may sound like a pitch, but it's true. I'm not selling anything and it cheap to try it for yourself...but first, a little history to show that I'm serious that I had this. If you don't care about me, skip to the end.\nI'm a 50 year old white male, no major illnesses, some anxiety (mostly freeway driving based) I'm pretty sure I've been suffering from 'brain fog' for the last 5-7 years. My symptoms were: can't think straight, can't finish sentences without stuttering, can't find the right word to explain things so I would simplify my speech like a child, forgetting names, places, appointments etc. I was having trouble getting a full nights sleep 5 out of 7 days of the week, waking up multiple times (I assumed this was normal for my age) ...and tinnitus, occasional dizziness and mild vertigo.\nEvery once in a while I got a reprieve from the symptoms for a day here and there and felt like myself again but couldn't find a common link in sleep/diet/alcohol consumption/activity level. (the fog rolls in/the fog rolls out)\nNext part of the story. My mother had dementia for the last 6 years or so. My step father was trying all the normal medicines plus exercise, diet, whatever, it didn't matter, it never does. When she passed away he gave away all her things to the family, one of the things he gave me was her expensive CBD gummies. I assumed they were a joke like most \"super cure-all's\" you see in the heath isle of whatever hip store you shop at. I ate one here and there because they really did taste good and they were sitting next to the Motrin.\nOne night I had some back pain (shoulder stress from hunching, deskjob) so I hit the motrin and ate a tasty gummy (one of four left). I noticed the next morning that I had slept ALL NIGHT in the same position, my brain candle was fully lit and I was totally functional/conversational all day at work. I wanted to try it again so I did the same thing (ate one before bed, cut out the Motrin) with the same results. I ran out of gummies so I went to local hip grocery store and got some liquid stuff (tastes kinda gamey, but whatever) , put one dropper full in my mouth before bed and have been fog free for the last three weeks.\nSo thats it....as far as I can tell, CBD worked for me. At some point I will run a control test and go a week without it. It's cheap, no side effects and available everywhere.\nI hope, I really do, that this helps someone.\nBest regards-Mr Church\nReport\nReply"
